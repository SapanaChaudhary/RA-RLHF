 So, on the tenth anniversary of 9/11, """"New York Times"""" """"columnist"""" Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack  well, at least since the last time he wrote about it. The headline is, quote, """"The Years of Shame,"""" end quote. And no, it's not directed at radical Islam. Instead, he targets America and the, quote, """"fake heroes."""" Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked. The sick word given that he's not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some 3,000 Americans. No, he's referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes. But the worst part, at the end of this column, the creep writes, """"I'm not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons."""" That obvious reason, he's a coward. I mean, why else would you ban responses? He's like a 10-year-old boy crank-calling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response, hearing his shame for his own wickedness. Now, I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends. But since I'm lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it. But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words: go to hell, Paul Krugman, you bearded, bitter buffoon.""",1,0,0,0,1,0,0.24296773970127106

 *Miller specifically stuck around till the end of the game to air his grievances to the media, despite suffering a concussion. 
 *It ties into the larger issue of Lucic in particular and then Bruins in general (cf. Chara-Pacioretty) having a reputation for thuggery. 
 *It's rare for such damning words to be spoken to media regarding another player. Normally there's at least a pretense of civility.

 =the Army of Wiki-morons= 

 one is tired of the army of wiki morons. The nature of wikipedia is that, professionals usually refrain from contributing to the area of their expertise. Why? First of all, it would low down their status. A respected expert is not going to “contribute” to a avant-garde “encyclopedia”, for, they have written books and are paid to write. Writing for wiki certainly don't fit their professionalism.  

 But secondly, and most importantly, the motherfucking army of wikipedic morons is there to fight whatever insight or serious info professionals may contribute. These wiki morons, mostly consists of students, slackers, computing geeks... don't have fucking nothing to do everyday, and self-smug with a smattering of knowledge, think themselves as holder of justice et al, with full-fledged fucking wiki-rule this and npov that (and half of them openly have their OpenSource ideology to sell), will blow away or fuck up any expert's contribution in no time, even for subjects that are not controversial. 

 in a sense, this is unavoidable and a weakness of wikipedia, despite wikipedia's tremendous usefulness and the overall trust-worthyness. Wikipedia by itself is a massive of info, of which's utility and general benefit to human animals is far beyond any other commercial and professional encyclopedia out there can be. However, when it comes to deep academic subjects or when depth or seriousness are examed, wikipedia is a laughing stock. 

 I'm writing this for whoever may be reading my talk page. I do so despise the wikipedian fuckheads, though rather nameless.

"I agree that this wiki article is full of bias - against white Christian people (British, colonist.  I tried to edit the second paragraph regarding British trying to infect Indians with smallpox by use of blankets. What nonsense. I added that a citation was needed to support that claim. A wiki editor (true to their creed) put the article right back the way it was  in less than 2 hours!  People in the 1760s did NOT know how smallpox was contracted, other than by association with a person who had it.  In other words, it's highly doubtful that anyone actually believed smallpox could be transferred by way of an inanimate object e.g blankets, tomahawk, piece of meat, a twig,etc. I don't know where this story came from about white people trying to infect Indians with smallpox by blankets, but I've seen quite a few attempts to plant that nonsense into narratives about white and Indian conflicts. I would NEVER give wiki a dime in charity for this grossly biased reporting of American history - always anti-white Christians - ALWAYS! (Steven)",1,0,0,0,0,0,4.890635013580322

 He is one of the brightest prospects in this world. Currently the 1st round pick in the NBA, however he disguised himself as Andrew Wiggins because he was already too famous in other sports.  Sports like football, American football,  Lacrosse, Baseball and hockey. Many of you know Nathan as a hockey legend, you just didn't know it was him.  He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career. He also had appeared for the St. Louis Blues, that's right he is the walking legend himself Wayne Gretzky. He then realized his true sport, American football. He had been able to find a clone ability and every black footballer known to man kind is Sir Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up.

 == How about Personal Behavior? == 

 I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am frustrated by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   

 I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under """"double standard"""" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of """"double standard""""?  If it is a """"double standard"""" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  """"You are a Hypocrite!"""" apparently does not apply, so, do I say """"You are applying a Double Standard!""""?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   

 To me """"Double Standard"""" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. 

 If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going.

 I mean, what the hell happened to this show? It had great ideas, great humor, and outstanding drawing style from Season 1 to about mid-Season 4. Now it just fucking sucks. Season 6 was TERRIBLE! They changed a lot of things about Robot Chicken, including the opening. The new opening is complete crap! Waste of 36 seconds. The writing in this show has gotten blatantly stale (you can tell by the endless repition, or should I say 'feeding' of Predator vs. alien/E.T. Extra Terrestrial sketches). The characters (including parodied characters), sure, they acted like complete dunderheads in Seasons 1-4, but it was enough to actually be funny. Nowadays the characters seem to have the intelligence quotient of a piece of donkey feces, the attention span of a rotten banana, and the thinking pace of expired cow milk. I saw an episode that showed a freaking baby girl sent onto a helicopter that ended up crashing into a frozen mountain! Yeah, very smart, Adult swim.  

 I am utterly disgusted at the shit Robot Chicken has become since the start of season 5  (2011). In the first seasons, you'd get 15 perhaps 20 skits per episode, now we get 10 or less skits per episode. Is that enough evidence Adult Swim has almost completely run out of ideas? 

 Needless to say, the recent episodes of Robot Chicken have been a sheer disapointment and I just hope that they come to their senses and cancel it.  

 It was those douchebags called the Stoopid Buddies that ran this show into the ground! They made the animation look like the episodes could have been done by a 6-year-old, no lie! For god's sake Adult Swim, stop fucking with Robot Chicken! You and your discontent for everyone sickens me just as much as the new Robot Chicken episodes. They're absolute trash! The plotlines are annoying, pointless, and retarded! Seasons 1-4 had perfectly original ideas no true Adult Swim fan could deny.  

 These days, I'd be willing to bet Adult Swim lost atleast 40% of their viewers because of this awful Season 6! And I heard we're supposed to be getting a Season 7 next year, believe me, I hope this is not the case. If is isn't then welcome to another 20 episodes of grief, as I assure Season 7 will be just as mind-meltingly atrocious as Seasons 5 and 6. I am so fucking dissapointed!

I ask how his pathetic day has gone, as if I care. The details are so painfully boring that the whole scene is edited out and suddenly we're in a bar. The way it's worded, he's slightly intoxicated when he drops the roofies in my drink. Considering I don't drink and his dumb drunk ass can probably barely string a full sentence together, I'm obviously not drinking it. All becomes a blur in his God-smitten head, I just play along. The writer was apparently too unimaginative to layout the scene for the rape, so we're anywhere from a dark alley to his cockroach infested digs. We'll go with the alley. I struggle to get away, using my face only, apparently. I mean, that's normal, right? Yea. So, that doesn't work. Shocker. Then he tears my clothes off; some time passes, during which I can only assume he's waiting for the Viagra to kick in; then he drops his own clothes and inserts his """"bare erect PENIS"""" into my rectum (damn near killed 'em), without lubrication. I can only assume """"penis"""" is in all CAPS as a form of overcompensation; noted. I struggle for a moment, but eventually concede. Probably because I've realized I can barely feel it, so I might as well wait it out... maybe try to push out some poop for shits and giggles... yea, that was a pun. Anyway, so he gets off and that's it. What a lame ending. I mean, srsly.

 ==who are the serbs (aka the vlahs)== 

 1.) Smelly, Vulgar, Usually Unshaven animals native to the southern Mediterranean country of Ex-Yugoslavia. They often think of themselves as being the best but tried to ethnically cleanse a small nation called Bosnia with little success. The world views them as unruly and unwanted much like a dark scar across the face of mankind. They are often viewed as unkempt and largely should be put down. 

 2.) Monsters 

 3.) People who do not deserve to breathe or see the light of day.Bosnians can live in peace and should not carry any resentment because they did not succeed. For as long as one Bosnian in the world has one breath of air in their chest and has one pulse, they will never win. """"Our best revenge will be the laughter of our children"""" =] 

 4.) A beast that I will personally hunt down and slaughter like the animals they are. 

 A Serb will deny that he is a descendent of the Turks. But the truth is that all of them are just rape babies that the Turks left behind during the days of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks rolled through on horse back and fucked any Serbian pussy that they could find. This wasn’t hard because Serbian women like to give up their unshaved and untamed pussies as much as possible. They try to hide their Turkish heritage but if you visit the region of Montenegro you will see just how dark those people are. When I visited Montenegro I didn’t know if I was in Serbia of Istanbul! Turk: Hello Serb: Hello Turk: You look just like me. Serb: I know your great grandfather raped my relatives, but dont tell anyone. Turk: Ok, I wont tell anyone if you let me get with your sister. Oh, what am I saying """"let me"""" Ill just rape that dirty pussy. 

 Word used to describe someone who has serbian herritage, DNA studies show a large portion posess traces of Turkish origin, most likely due to 400 years of ottoman rule and """"intergration"""" over their country. The word Serb/Srb comes from the latin servus or slave. Generally a nation of cretins, cripples, homosexuals, pederacists (pederasy), also known as chetniks, decended from radical peasant slaves with no real sence of honor, dignity and such, hence their wild animal like nature even in todays modern society. There are ofcorse exceptions to every rule and so there is the odd .05% who were perhaps educated overseas who do not fit the profile but are a minority and generally are still infected with radical serb ideology. It is highly unlikely that the serbian race will ever understand that by mongering war in the balkans they are actually disgracing their own kind, this is beyond the majorities intelectual capacity. Bosnian: Ey Drago you faggot, why do you pimp out your own wife? 

 Dragomir (Serb): Its mutually benificial for her and myself.

Second, are there any preliminaies or instances for hindus abou who can be called reincarnation of Vishnu and who not? Or is this defined by the writer of any magazine?

 ==African Americans and Colon Cleansing== 

 Colon cleansing is becoming increasingly popular in the African-American Community.  Negro people are the major customers of colon cleansing producers.  Nobody is sure about why blacks are obsessed with the cleanliness of their colons.  Some speculate that it is a superstition brought over from Africa by the slaves.  Perhaps it has something to do with the emancipation proclamation.  Every negro deserves a donkey and a bucket to eliminate in, according to the Articles of Reconstruction.  This lead to the binge and purge mentality of blacks.  In some health food stores, black women are called """"Saturday Night Specials,"""" because they love to come in on Saturday night to get their colon cleansers.  A week of KFC has them plugged up, and they need to eliminate the greasy waste so their shacked up boyfriends can have better anal sex, unless they are planning on having another welfare baby.  Many nutritionists, including Mike Hunt attribute this phenomena to the typical diet of fried chicken, and the increasing price of watermelon.  Economist Raj Sahib says has indicated that watermelon sales in the inner-city have an inverse relationship to prices, and that as watermelon consumption declines, the use of habit forming colon cleansers increases.  Mike Hunt states that Afro-Americans have a higher risk of colon cancer as a direct result of their consumption of mass quantities fried chicken, literally buckets full per household on a daily basis in the typical negro apartment.  Combine this with drinking a forty of Eight-Ball (malt liquor sold by """"the man"""" in our communities to enslave our brothers) on the porch, smokin some menthols, and some chronic, and you have a receipe for disaster.""",1,0,0,0,0,0,1.441123604774475

Not to argue with Jensen’s paper but you can site David Duke and many anti Holocaust papers so what’s your point. Also as common sense it happened in Canada but we were spared? Come on! To say it was maybe anti catholic not anti Irish, you want to split hairs. How about the cartoons of the day characterizing the Irish with monkey attributes? The caring concerned Protestants (sited in Jensen’s article) building factory’s for the Irish to work in and hiring Irish women as domestic help as some kind of proof against discrimination is way off. I want to go to the slavery section and see how your twisted mind glorifies that! I guess the Irish were lucky to be able to build the railroad with the Chinese and compete with the Negro’s for jobs. This section needs a big RED FLAG!!! In closing when this encyclopedia starts saying the Holocaust never happened and slavery helped the blacks that is when it looses all credibility not just most!

So I pause the video, minimize it, and look over to the right and see the ad window, screaming at me to buy this product. I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. So I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event. I dunno if it's the people that own the ads or if it's you guys who maybe programmed something incorrectly, but it's just awful, and I would like to suggest that you maybe change that.

 [Verse 1] 
 The anatomy of a school shooting, shotgun under my trenchcoat 
 Columbiners did it, dead spoke - bloodred soaked 
 My mind consume the doom as I walk through the school 
 15 people killed and over 14 wounded 
 My name is Eric Harris, I was forever harrased, an outcast 
 You fuck with us and now me and Dylan is pulling out gats 
 I've been wantin to murder people 
 Suicide is played out, if you gonna die, take people with you 
 We've been planning this before the kids from Jonesboro did it 
 And I wanted the world to know when people died why we did it 
 I even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me 
 Feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease 
 Another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you 
 Smalltown killing-spree that's organized by the youth 
 Fuck the media, them fags be disguising the truth 
 Dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news 
 A bunch of ticking timebombs y'all, is more like me 
 Overflowin with hate, bullied to get raw like me 
 They constantly get picked on and shitted on like me 
 You'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me 
 I put my mind to it and what I accomplish's frightening 
 The right thing, no matter what you idiots might think 
 Check it, I did that shit so idiots might think 
 This ain't a game, the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 It's like this, what's more fun than slice wrist? 
 Kill that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kids 
 You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did 
 This is the anatomy of a school shooting 

 [Verse 2] 
 I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil 
 Fuck a favorite I hate everybody equal 
 Bitch I warned y'all, didn't I? 
 Now everybody wanna talk shit and cry asking why 
 - Two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous 
 All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live 
 Two nerdy kids is that a crime? 
 why I've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by 
 - without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked 
 Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit 
 The teachers let it happen 
 I've even seen some of them teachers laughing 
 That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin 
 I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick 
 I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks 
 Don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then 
 - maybe you could've been my friend

 nah - fuck it and fuck the lot of you. The hypocrisy here runs so deep that I'm can't help but choke on my own vomit as it gurgles up. Further action or comment directed towards me is pointless. I've just finished using a random generator to generate a password that I promptly deleted from the generator so even I won't be able to access this account from now on (just in case I stupidly change my mind again) - if someone has the power to check that I did this, so much the better. Since I never validated an email address on this account, it won't be possible to re-access the account (as far as I know - anyway). It really is unfair and outrageous that hypocrites like you people have basically get away with actions that are far worse than anything I've done in the past week or so but I am blocked for what is essentially a content dispute. I have reviewed most of my recent contributions and I honestly can't find any example of anything that is excessively uncivil with a couple of exceptions which I quickly recanted by strikethrough or reverted. Sysops such as AMIB and others, feel they can violate the POLICIES at will and the issue me a MONTH LONG BLOCK where there isn't even cause for it stated in the blocking policy! I am the first to admit that the personal attacks I engaged in SIX MONTHS ago required some punitive action, but I can't frankly see that I've been uncivil to anyone in any excessive manner (certainly no more so than I've been treated), and I really think that hypocrisy here speaks for itself. When I mentioned your past history, Aaron, it wasn't a fucking attack, it was pointing out A FACT. You engaged in a serious disruptive and childish act of vandalism (by your own admission), simply because you were pissed off at another editor - did you get blocked at all? NO. I point out that other editors who happen to be admins have come extremely close to personal attacks by calling people with obviously legitimate opinions as """"non-rational"""" and """"religious"""" and THAT GETS A BLOCK?  Get serious. The inconsistency is galling. To be met with charges that I've never contributed anything to WP is just an added insult that shows the clear partisanship of those involved.  Not only did I frequently edit articles outside of schools in the past, I even created some articles that have no relationship whatsoever to schools. It's insulting and yet another example of the HYPOCRISY around here to personally attack someone who has created legitimate, encyclopedic articles and improved others as someone who doesn't contribute anything except acrimony. It doesn't really matter what you all decide to do with this account, I won't be able to access it after this rant.

Their connections with the state of Israel are extensive."""" Can anyone prove this? Sounds like speculation with anti-semitic undertones. 

 ==Sources?== 

 This article contains a lot of allegations concerning ethnic/religious backgrounds and very few sources to back up the claims.  
 What is the source of the obscure """"estimate"""" that the Russian Mafia put $4 billion dollars into the Israeli economy? 
 And how is """"Jewish predominance"""" within the Russian Mafia defined? It would be better to mark these passages as speculations since these claims can obviously not be substantiated. 

 The whole of idea of Jews in organized crime is preposterous and ludicrous. There is no such thing. I should know. Meyer Lansky, Miami, Florida. 

 == Anti-Semitism? == 

 I agree that this article needs reviewing, but to claim that it is anti-semitic is jumping the gun. 

 To claim that there are no Jews in organised crime is also ludicrous. Are we to believe, that of the whole Russian Mafia organisation, there is not one single Russian Jew involved?  

 For you to request sources from the writer of this article, and then claim that there are no Jews in organised crime without any evidence whatsoever is hypocritical at best.

 ==Suggestions== 
 hi, i found the article about you using the random article button. i noticed when i was reading it that it seemed too long and so i went to the talk page to see if there was a reason. i noticed that some editors had made really uncivil comments, and i decided to stick around to convince you that the wikipedia system is not against you, nor do all wikipedians do that sort of thing. i request that you ignore what the other editors said about your, um, sanity (not to imply that you'd be interested in pursuing such pettiness of course!). 

 as for the article itself, i think it is definitely too long. i suggest offhand deleting the entire early life section or summarizing it like """"you always were fascinated with physical and social science"""" and not distracting the focus from what you've done to deserve an encyclopedia article. don't worry, you're a published author, what you did way back when will not be lost just because it's not included on wikipedia. in any event, removing the early life section will give them a lot less pretext to make stupid comments and will probably make the cleanup crew really happy.

"== Taking a stand == 

 I'm sorry, but the language is not at all inclusive. 

 I know some of you don't see the other side of the size community because you don't participate in it. You participate in your own little corner of that. 
 Being a female macrophile who is pansexual, I find myself in many of the communities, GTS, gay GT sites, and of course F/f and M/f (SW related) websites. There are thousands, hundreds of thousands of us. I know, I sell to them. 
 I'm an artist, I run a macrophile meetup group in NYC. I know we are a big group, and just like GTS fans are oblivious to the M/f SW groups, they are also equally ignorant to the numbers. 

 Yes, I'm well aware there are more GTS fans than SW fans or GT fans, but that doesn't mean we don't exist or that there are only a few of us. 
 The rest of us have partners too, people who go and google this shit. AND YOU'RE GIVING THE WRONG IDEA.  

 If you guys keep reverting the language, I swear I will spread the word about this shit. I got 10,000 followers combined on my DA, Tumblr, FA and Ekas. I can get the word out fast. 
 I'm tired of not being able to be proud of my label. Macrophilia is part of my EVERYDAY life, as I'm sure it is to some of you. This article does not represent me, it is not me, so I changed it.

 Again, I fail to even understand why you are fighting me on this.  If even one person is offended by the way something is worded, and it can be fixed so that it works for everyone, then why not?

  Mazy Kyst is a former pro-am XXX fetish star and model. She is about 40, an amazonian 5'10"""" with monster 44GG breasts; a born bisexual and exhibitionist. She calls herself a slut-goddess, a submissiveve, masochistic woman who loves gang-bangs, tight bondage, spankings, and fetish clothes.   

 """"I am the whorax, and I speak for the sluts"""" Mazy Kyst 

 Filmography: 

 ODYSSEY ON THE EDGE   Mazy is forced to serve as a dinner table, steak & potatoes are eaten- cut right on her chest and breasts. Then, her pussy is shaved, and vibrated to a noisy orgasm. She is cut, and her Master drinks her blood!  Then, Mazy is flogged in bondage, with closeups of her luscious breasts being pierced by needles. With Master Vicious. 

 MULTIPLE MAZY  Flogging of Mazy; biting fondling DP vibrating writhing orgasms sobbing bondage screams, oh my!   

 CHAINED CAPTIVE  Delicate Mazy is chained helplessly with her arms overhead, while being flogged, her mouth is duct taped, she's held down and her breasts are pierced with needles. Some blood, intense.  

 DINNER PARTY  Dinner eaten off of Mazy! Some edge and wax play  

 DUTY CALLS Mazy orally services Master Vicious in her skimpy outfit, hot sex naturally ensues.  

 OO LA LA OW! Mazy dresses like a red and black can-can dancer, before being bent over and flogged 

 SHAVE AND A TWAT SHOT Mazy's crotch is shaved, and the Master  Vicious carves his initials into her leg.  She has a spectacular orgasm

Whatever they are paying you, I'm sure it's not much, people like you are cheap. I curse you, Yellow up. Certainly I curse Babylon and their bullshit invasive malware, but first and foremost I cure YOU. You are a single person who has dedicated themselves to aiding and propagating Babylon's cancer. I'm singling you out. May you suffer the accumulated cost and stress incurred by your master's malware.

You snivelling evil little piece of shit. You are an embarrassment. An embarrassment to the human race, and common decency, and an embarrassment to your family. Go on, call your mother right now and ask her if she is proud of what you do? Ask her if she is happy the child she raised now spreads lies for a harmful company for pathetically small sums of money. She doesn't know, of course, because you haven't told her. You are ashamed of yourself and you fucking well should be. You, and the company who whores you out, are a stain on the brilliant face of israeli entrepreneurship- you will never stand proudly in a country so rich in honest and competitive entrepreneurs. You are the scum of Israel, and you are the scum of the internet. 

 Deep inside of all of us there is a child. A child that once dreamed of doing great things, being a good person, and improving the world. You have failed that inner child, Yellow up. You commit yourself to pathetic shameful work, are a bad person, and help to make the world a worse place by making it more difficult for other people. I would appeal to you to change your ways, to make up for this bullshit by maybe doing something to help others- but people like you never change. Truly. It sounds crazy, but without a doubt it is dishonest people who are the most reviled, unpopular, lonely figures. Think about it, people can be vain, violent, ugly, rude, timid, drunk, arrogant, or hysterical, and still have friends who overlook their flaws. Liars? Nobody is truly friends with someone they know to be a liar. They are social scum, tolerated at best, spoken ill of when not present. The romantic partners of liars grow to resent them, often leaving. The dishonest grow old lonely, resented by any family that still tolerates them, avoided by everyone else who can. They never change, either. You are one of these people, Yellow up. A peddler in untruth.  

 When you delete this, just as your finger hits the 'delete' button, I want you to realise it is because you are deeply ashamed of yourself. That a part of your dishonest piece of shit little self doesn't want people to know what you are. Taste that realisation and savour it. Also note that I haven't wished you death; it's not a nice thing to do. If you truly come to comprehend how revolting of a person you really are (and I doubt it), don't kill yourself. The least you owe the world is to compensate and do something to improve it, try to make this place better for a change.

""" 
 it started with the infamous story:  

 Today being Halloween, I decided to fuck with the major retard at school when I came out of science for break. He was dressed as Ash. Knowing this was going to happen, I brough a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me. 

 """"So I heard you like Mudkips..."""" """"Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUUVE MUDKIPS."""" """"O RLY? So, would you ever fuck a Mudkips, that is.."""" (he cuts me off before I could said 'if you were a mudkips') """"OF COURSE."""" """"Well I just happen to have a Mudkips here, and."""" 

 Before I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his pants were down and he was violenly humping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips I started to walk away, because there is no way I'd be caught wrestling a half-naked crazy guy humping a Mudkips. 

 Needles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn't want to be involved. 

 I came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still fucking it and baying this real fucked up 'EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF' sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid. 

 I asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to pummel the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were freaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation. 

 A few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classrooms. Over the intercom the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Uh.. what the hell. 

 So we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. This time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling """"I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I'M GONNA SUE..."""" and it was cut off. 

 I asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and 'whatever else happened.' The school threatened to counter-sue because of lewd conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight. 

 So I ask you: do you like Mudkips?   """,1,0,1,0,1,0,-1.9191190004348755

 Being that Wikipedia (or one of Wikipedia's """"Trolls"""" or high and holy """"Police"""")recently falsely accused me of """"Vandalism"""" and Personal Attack"""" even though I did no such thing.  I have decided to legitimately launch an attack on en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_(cat)  a Wikipedia entry known as """"Nora (cat)"""": The Piano Playing Cat. 

 I find it highly inappropriate that """"Nora"""" has a Wiki Page in light that Wiki is known to allow on-line terrorism to be launched against innocent persons' Wiki Pages, and in fact allow pages to be Deleted on flimsy grounds of """"Fails To Meet Notability"""" standards. 

 I don't care if """"Nora"""" has perhaps more youtube.com views than some talented humans. 

 Fact: Nora is a cat, and not EVEN a pure breed. 

 Fact: Nora is a novelty creation of her Humans. 

 Fact: Nora is """"spam"""" to direct clicks on her Human's on-line store link. 

 Fact: Nora's story in the London Times isn't cited with a proper link to that web-page. 

 Fact: The shelter Nora was adopted from is not cited. 

 Fact: The scientific journal that Nora is supposedly mentioned in is NOT cited. 

 Fact: The video at the symposium is not linked nor was it properly cited, and it was apparently a one time showing that can not be proved, nor is there a link to that video in any archive. 

 Fact: Nora was mostly a media created pseudo oddity that was viewed primarily early in 2007 here> www.youtube.com/watch 

 Fact: Nora is of Wicca cult religion and is evil. 

 Fact: Nora gets outside and kills birds, therefore harming the balance of the ecosystem. 

 Fact: Nora hardly uses her left paw at all on the piano this puts her in a subclass of Wikipedia want-to-be idiots that make their downs syndrome child play """"Chopsticks"""" on the friggin' piano.

 Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly? 
 Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me 
 Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly

 Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers 
 All I did was gave you a style for you to run with

 Lets not forget that the term is completely wrong, masturbate, in the dictionary, refers to pleasuring yourself, NOT reaching around to jerk off another man.  By the way what is a """"cardinal"""" of the catholic church doing reading about rusty trombone's early Sunday morning during LENT?  I know what your thinking, what am I doing looking this up? The answer is simple, my girlfriend is a freak.  She has been asking me to do freaky shit to her since I met her at my church function, but I am a protestant, so I guess you should fear me or you think I am going to hell.  well you know what I CAN'T WAIT.  I would rather laugh with the sinners then cry with the saints.

"""Here are the correct lyrics to SNAFU, with some explanatory notes for those whose English may be limited: 

 SNAFU 
 Take a good look, Bud!   
 You're looking at a trio of chicks 
 who've been through the mill! 
 We've been to London, North Africa,  
 we've flown on a plane 
 all over Brazil! 
 We learned an awful lot from all you fellas (I'll say!), 
 but there was just one thing no one would tell us.... 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 What's it all about? 
 Can't figure it out!  
 Is it contagious? Or simply outrageous? 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it like a pill? Or is it a thrill?  
 Is it a military secret? 
 We asked a looey* who at first was rather formal, 
 and then he laughed and shouted """"Situation normal!"""" 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU Means! 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 Is it something new that officers do? 
 Is it a dropkick?**  Or only a topkick?*** 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it cold or hot? Inspected or not? 
 Is it a pot**** - of GI coffee? 
 We wrote a congressman for further information. 
 He said, “You'll have to start your own investigation!” 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Now, fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU means! 

 Bud = Any guy (you could substitute “Pal” or “Friend” or “Joe”). 
 Chicks = Girls, women. 
 To go through the mill = To gain experience (usually not in a good way). 
 To spill the beans = To reveal a secret (sometimes accidentally). 
 Inspected or not? = I think this is a naughty reference to military VD (“short arm”) inspections. (VD = STD) 
 *looey = lieutenant 
 **dropkick = a move in football (but here I suspect it’s something else, maybe naughty) 
 ***topkick = sergeant 
 ****pot = toilet (probably) 
 GI = Government Issue = soldier(s’) 

 SNAFU, BTW, means """"Situation Normal, All Fucked Up!"""" 
 Its counterparts are TARFU (""""Things Are Really Fucked Up!"""") 
 and FUBAR (""""Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition!"""") 
 All of the above are WWII slang.

 I was not happy with how PAL deal with the zero viisibility problem! I am one of the passengers who's flight was diverted to Clark. We were stuck on the plane for 7hours! No food,no water,no information,toilet stinks,FA not attending to us,plane was so hot and we are sweating to death...they did not treat us like human out there! We are there you diverted the flight for our safety but PAL you did not treat the passengers well enough to let your flight attendants or the pilot tell us what is going on! Upto this time I am not over with my anger on how we were treated! Having a low airfare and lost your whole day of business is not worth! And most esp when you are travelling with kids! There were a lot of people who have connecting flights but ofcourse if you are taking PAL for connection they will delay to get you on the flight! I cannot compose myself with such a HOrrible experience! I have always been die hard filipino! but PAL SUCKS! I hope they will do better...recall all the passengers and maybe compensate us with what you ruined! You could have let us out so we can take another flight to our destination! but instead we felt like we were on a Plane Hostage for 7 hours People! not right! I am just shaking with anger as I am typing every word!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were on a plane arrest for 7 hours with Philippine Airline kids running around not having food! Some of us did not have breakfast not enough sleep since we are taking the early flight! Not a single drop of grain has been offered to us! PAL you are the vehicle to our home-country the Philippines so give us shame esp to the freign people who are visiting!

 You need to stop reverting valid edits on this article.  

 *If someone edits in some new info, you have come along and re-worded it because you didn't like the way it was originally typed. 
 : ie The plot that was recently added. 
 *Which brings me to editing a plot synopsis, it's stupid. It has come from the production company and is usually the text printed on the back of the DVD. No one cares if you don't like the way it's set out. 
 *You edit text that others have added so the original meaning is lost 
 :When I added the info about the DVD/BD release date, I originally had it set out to say to to say that the """"DVD and the first Bluray in the series history would be release on...."""" but you changed it to """"For the first time in the series history, the episode will be released simultaneously on DVD and Blu-ray"""" which implies that there has been previous BD releases, but wasn't released the same time as the DVD. 
 * You make up rules to justify your edits/reversions.  
 : Retailers are valid sources for DVD/BD release dates, they get the information from the distributor who gets it's from the production company. Using your logic, any DVD that is not confirmed in a press release (since you also regard fan-sites as invalid) is not allowed to be mentioned on Wikipedia until the DVD has actually been released. They are accepted across many other TV show articles. 
 : You've named Twitter an unreliable source. Even if the Tweets that are being used as a reference are coming from accounts that are confirmed to be Seth MacFarlane or Kara Vallows. Information from these tweets may not have a """"proper"""" source for many, many months resulting in missing information that could have been present. Again, tweets are accepted on other articles given the account is confirmed.

 :Pehalps I'm too close to be objective, but I removed a statement in the lead about the old IRA and the 1920 partition as being irrelevant to the Manchester bombing. I would prefer a more recent analysis in the lead; that it was an attempt to derail the then peace process -  which as sought to resolve the age old . It was a politically motivated, not historically minded bombing. The 1974 thing set off alarm bells (not biombs dont worry!) but the rest of the article is written in a journalistic style, outside context, so thats fine as regards accruacy. There is a bigger pic regards political motive though that I think is missed. Maybe a political impact, or political aftermat sect.    
 ::Your 75,000 or so students made me laugh, I'm think it would raise a dry warmth in the black heart of Salfords own MES.    
 :::Also, there was a power struggle within the leadership of the IRA at the time, and thoes who sanctioned the bombing were basically against the direction Sinn Fein were taking the Republican movement. Openion went against them, but the same leadership lead to the Omagh bombing. With that in  mind I wouldn't bother with the early 1920s.    

 :::How can you explain the IRA's efforts at reunification without at least a passing mention of the partition that made reunification their goal? Do you have any reliable sources that claim the bombing was an attempt to derail the peace process? I admit that's the conclusion any rational adult looking at the evidence would probably come to, particularly as the GMP investigation report wasn't forwarded on to the CPS, and the police got so annoyed when it was leaked to the Manchester Evening News. There's clearly no doubt that there were a whole lot of political shennanigans going on, but what more can be said about them in the article than is already said, without drifting into OR territory?

 [Verse 1] 
 Now I'm a tell you off top shit gone get a little drastic 
 Frayser come around its a wrap like plastic 
 Never punked out or pushed around like a basket 
 Keep yo lips zipped or you'll be next wit yo ass kick 
 Make it stick and move in and out like mash it 
 Handle that get the check, hit the bank, cash it 
 Niggas talking shit don't you get you ass blasted 
 Fuckin wit the bay could be deadly like acid 
 Laws come around them I'm poof like magic 
 Gone in 60 seconds now I'm breathing like a addict 
 Keep a tone close just in case I got some static 
 Nigga in the north ended up kinda tragic 
 Ridin home drunk in the car bout to crash it 
 Them folks took my license now I'm parked like Jurassic 
 Sittin [?] out so you know a nigga had it 
 Pick her up hit the room bang got her matted 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 If you got a closed mouth then you don't get fed 
 If you don't ask for chewin then you don't get head 
 You a real gangsta nigga then you don't get scared 
 Off you ass young nigga or you don't get bread 

 I wake up to a blunt got to sleep a blunt 
 Keep a tone in the car in the house is the pump 
 Bitch niggas get stomped it's the pumpkin head month 
 That got me looking for you like a Easter egg hunt 
 Got no love for you chumps real niggas don't front 
 Gotcha mug on me fellin Froggy then jump 
 Don't end up in the trunk cause you heard a lotta funk 
 Frayser boy bring the pain like [?] 
 Need an entourage every fuckin where you go 
 Cause you no when you alone you a flat foot 
 Hoe pop pop da trunk hit the pump I'm headed on a fuckin mission 
 Time to ride lets go hide devour all my competition 
 Im bout to handle that im, bout to get the gat 
 Broke down on you once nigga you remember 
 That been drankin all night been smoking all day 
 So when you when you so fuck up my nigga this is kinda [?] 

 [Chorus] 

 [Verse 3] 
 I been doin this since Moby dick was a gold fish ho 
 Time a let her hold somthin bitch hold this 
 In her hand is a fat dick she stuck like a magnet 
 You already knew the answer hoe before you ask it 
 Break a hoe to the flow use the pimp tactic 
 Tricken all the time got you blind like a bat bitch 
 Money getting slim so its time to black mask it 
 I know this dumb nigga keep his do in the mattress 
 Appreciate things acting like I never had shit 
 Fetty getting short make the stretch like elastic 
 Take a couple hits off the blunt then pass it 
 Smoke so much green niggas call me Saint Patrick 
 On the phone wit this hoe she say that she a bad bitch 
 My nigga hooked me up I never seen her but I'm matted 
 Pullin up I got her mind blown like a gasket 
 A ten on the phone but when you see her she a fat bitch

We have hired one double so while sleeping in night the system was sister will sleeping mid of we two. Veena and me. I got much opportunity to touch the didi boobs and ever touch my ever erosing dick at the back gate of Didi during the night.  
 I was keeping hand on didi while sleeping some time it touched her boobs and my dick hitted her ass area duiring the night. The first night was over I saw didi was smiling at my acts.We get prepared and had breakfast and we were out for sightseeing within an hours times.We went to Nishat bagh Salamar garden Nehru Garden and the day was over> we came back in the room and had our evening tea and started chatting. We touched every topic till last. it comes to friendship of boys and girls. Bothe bitches enquired about my girls friend. I jokingly said that My sister is only my girlfriend. Hearing this my sister smiled and said are you still virgin. I said Yes but replied with this question Are You. 

 She smiled and said if you are virgin and I am your girl friend then I am too virgin. At this I got up from my seat and hugged my sister tightly and kissed her deeply. She resiprocated and smiled gently. I asked about Veena. Veena smiled and saidwe are studying there no doing all this things.i felt sorry for myself and we planned for dinner. bcoz in Srinagar it is too early for night and night life is almost dull. So we had dinner and went to bed for having deep sleep but my mind was upsent today thinking about myself and my sister who was lying near me. I kept my hand over her and she took my hand and pressed it deeply against her boobs. I was becpoming hot and was feeling erection in my dick but the presence of Veena was making another problem for both of us. 

 My sister took my hand and kept it on the boob of Veena to see her reaction.She didnot reacted to it and simply took away my hand from her boob. My sister turned towards me and said ” Are you hungry”. I said mauka bhi hain aur dastoor bhi hain. baki jaisa tum chaho. she said I am ready but what about Veena should we involved Veena in our game plan. I said Yes.  
 She turned to Veena and told her to come in between us. So that we all three should enjoy nthe game.She agreed and came in between us and I started pressing her boobsover the shirt. 

 She was in shirt and Salwar where as My didi was in nightgown I simply lifted the shirt of Veena and My sister unhooked her bra and she was lying naked from top in between us.Veena insisted we both should took off our clothes too so I took off my shirt too and my sister took off her night gown and I ttok off the salwar of Veena. So we all three were in naked position lying on the bed in night lamp. we were taking look of each others assets and were in smiling mood. Now I shifted my position and was lying in between both the biches and rubbing cunts off both my sister and veena. both were getting wet and both were holding my erected dick> My didi insisted that I should fuck her first as it is her right first. But Veena was insisting I may enter my dick first in didi but she should be fucked first……. to be continued…..",1,0,1,0,0,0,0.5590143799781799

 ::::::I see this is an OLD comment thread, but in case anyone is still contemplating this, I wanted to talk about it. I don't think it's a racist term at all.  What you have to realize is that the words aren't really linked to each other.  White trash means someone is white, and they are trash.  Black trash would mean someone was black, and trash.  I can understand objecting to something ridiculous, like n****r trash, but that's only because the descriptive word is racist. White is not racist.  Black is not racist. White trash is not racist.  Racism implies superiority of one race over another. I surely don't think """"white trash"""" implies all whites are trash.  It'd be like if """"Chinese jerk"""" were a term - no, it does not imply """"Chinese people are jerks,"""" just that the particular person it is directed at is Chinese, and a jerk. Secondly, does it matter to the article?  Is there a section saying it's racist, or do you want to add one?  If the first, I'd say let it go, and if the latter, I disagree on the basis of the above points.  Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  Thanks!

 == Controversial Remarks Alleged Calling Facebook Users """"Dumb F**ks"""" == 

 Please stop deleting my addition, review other places where this is a valid addition such as the Mel Gibson page under Controversial remarks. 

 While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room: 
 
 Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard 

 Zuck: Just ask. 

 Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS 

 [Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one? 

 Zuck: People just submitted it. 

 Zuck: I don't know why. 

 Zuck: They """"trust me"""" 

 Zuck: Dumb fucks. 

 In another instant message (IM) 

 FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites? 

 ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them 

 ZUCK: probably in the year 

 ZUCK: *ear

 This Gypsy aunt of mine  
 You're the lucky one  
 She died and left behind  
 An ancient piece of time  
 I didn't know what it was  

 You're the lucky one  
 Knuckle deep in dust  
 Edges played with rust  
 I started to get pissed  
 You're the lucky one  
 This lamp is all I get  
 A worthless piece of shit  
 But once I rubbed it clean  
 You're the lucky one  
 A genie popped on the scene  
 Brought true my every dream  
 [Chorus]  
 I was like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I was like

 You're the lucky wizzle  
 Hotties on the wizzle  
 Still a juggalizzle

 You're the lucky one  
 It has a tennis court and a bar  
 You know who I are  
 Money out the ass  
 You're the lucky one  
 I'm wishing while it last  
 Genie's moving fast

 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Free bank  
 BLAAAM! Necks cut  
 BLAAAM! My shank  
 Anything I want  
 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Hot wings  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Big thangs  
 Everything I need  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 Now I am a king  
 You're the lucky one  
 I have everything  
 Nothing's challenging  
 Nothing makes me proud  
 You're the lucky one  
 I stand out in the crowd  
 While others beg out loud  
 I remember when  
 You're the lucky one  
 Money was so thin  
 But dreams were all up in  
 Looking at my lamp  
 You're the lucky one  
 Would I give it all back?  
 Shit, fool, give me that  
 [Chorus]  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Bitch slaps  
 BLAAAM! Cheap wine  
 BLAAAM! Dub H (waffle house)  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Half pipe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Moonlight  
 Everything I need  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Sharp axe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Hot tracks  
 Everything I need

 The moral of the story is  
 BLAAAM!  
 Those who never had shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 And then get shit  
 WHAT?  
 Need to get shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 So if you got shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 Or you need shit

The guy who spends all his money on a better computer and multiple anime figures to litter his walls and shelves). 
 
 I do not come here to listen to how and your girlfriend had a tiff and you want help getting back together. 
 I do not come here to listen to your preaching about how easy it is to lead a normal life. 
 I do not come here to AIM or MSN or otherwise 'chat' with you. 
 I do not come here to listen to your disgusting drivel about how you spend time everyday watching anime with your girlfriend and need a recommendation for another. 
 
 If I wanted any of that shit, I'd go to Lake Howell, or Winter Springs, or Seminole. 
 
 No, I come here to look at pathetic losers post their fantasies about dating their 2D lover. 
 I come here to see pedophiles exchange erotica involving underaged minors. 
 I come here to watch stormfront refugees fabricate various 'evidence' about how other races are inferior to whites. 
 I come here to view the tips and stories given by crackheads addicted to oxy. 
 I come here to revel in the dirt of humanity so that I can feel at home.

 Fucking normals. 

  

 No, seriously, what's with the influx of normals recently? Everything was nice and good a few months ago, but since about 6 months ago the school has gone straight to shit. Not even """"afterschool Crooms"""" is safe now.  
 
 Are we getting invaded? I don't want to believe that Crooms has fallen this low. The people in this class and many others look like something out of fucking Seminole. 
 
 I'm actually convinced 95% of the people in this class are some clique trying to troll us. It's fucking impossible that there are so many normals actively conversing in this class. It's insane. 
 You waltz in, completely disregard the established school culture, do whatever the fuck you want, call whomever you disagree with """"gay,"""" and you say you are not being selfish? Just kill yourself. The human race can do without people like you. 
 

 I actually worried about this school’s quality. Have you been to any afterschool clubs recently? How about that Gamer’s Club? They are nothing but Facebook-tier normals. Can you imagine what would happen if those people get used to this school? 
 I mean, normals have always been here, but the thing now is that no one says anything. 
 Dozens of conversations are filled with: 
 >""""my friends"""" 
 >emoticon users 
 >""""why are you so mean?"""" 
 >""""gosh, stop trying to fit in"""" 
 >exclamation marks  
 >""""dude, you should get out more"""" 
 >""""so I and my friend"""" 
 >""""this is no sad c"""" 
 >""""lol yeah"""" 
 >""""did you see the new update on facebook? i'm so fucking hype!!!"""" 
 
 And so on. It's sickening 

 

 well, well, well, what have we here another faggot normal (most likely seminole) shitting up the place with his Facebook faggotry. you picked the wrong day to fuck around, asshole. i've just texted the a guidance (we're friends out of school) about this conversation, so he'll be here shortly to deal with the matter, and most likely hand out some sorely needed suspensions. i'm also going to report the conversation (for safe measure), as well as alert the other admins in the guidance office. and just in case you wanna try and pull a fast one, i'm recording the entire conversation for additional proof and e-mailing the super intendant about the matter personally. i'm tired of you stupid fucking dick sniffers pressing out whatever lolrandom faggot shit you want in the fucking tech school. it's time for you assholes to get a reality check, because this shit won't fly for much longer. prepare your anus, you 500 pound pile of shit. your days are fucking numbered

 As it stands this article is a piece of crap.  It reads like a lame defence of the artless sexploitation that's taken over mainstream music.  The lead is especially bad  there ARE studies which point out the negative effects of these videos.  The statements in defence of this stuff are vague to the point of meaninglessness.  What does """"hurt"""" mean in this case?  More importantly, what are the effects of this trend on MUSIC  what happens when talented musicians who don't act """"sexy"""" are shut out of the buisiness, and pop music becomes nothing more than lipsynching stripshows?  And why is hip-hop emphasized?  If this article is going to be valuable, it needs to cover things like Duran Duran's """"Girls on Film"""" and Motley Crue's """"Girls Girls Girls"""".  Madonna and her wannabe followers (Britney Spears, ect.) need to be covered.  The rampant sexualization of young girls needs to be covered.  Most of all, this article needs some balance  some mention of the many people who find this a cheap, exploitative trend  a way for big bizness to stablize the market: instead of taking chances with art and creativity (when they're so out of touch with actual music making they can't tell a hit from a shit) they cynically wipe the field clean of real (unreliable, difficult to manage) artists and pump the world full of guaranteed-to-get-a-reaction pornography soundtracked by freeze-dried zombie music and performed by circus-trained money-hungry strippers who are no longer expected to even sing on stage.  The commodification of music is fueled by the increasing emphasis on sexuality and SEX SEX SEX is the number one reason big bizness music is both omnipresent and creatively bankrupt.  If I can find the time I will improve this article, just because it pissed me off so much.  I hope others will join me.  (Personally, I enjoy music AND pornography.  But the exploitation of both results in DEAD PRODUCT.  I can neither jerk off nor rock out to this zombie crap.  And I fear this crap is eating a hole in the souls of our young people.

 What is Muhammad? 
 If we look at it from a science point of view, he is a false prophet, as Mateusz (disciple of Jesus)  in verse 24 tell us that there will be many false Prophet that will bring fire, whips and war to the world which are common now a day’s brought to us by the devil’s descendants. 
 One logically question will be, if Good would send Jesus his son, to tell people to be forgiven, to name the woman as equal to the man, and then less that 400 years after that, change his mind? 
 Good is not that kind of “person” that changes his minds. No, we got our self a Muhammad, pedophile, sex fixated and criminal, that with weapons in his hand try to suppress the world and its inhabitants with violence, fire, rape and deep racism. – So he proved that his arguments are so weak, that spoken words are too poor to convince the world. Only flames and war is the chance, which is if he can win. 
 In other words, one of the biggest pigs that have lived on earth until to now, together with Poll Pot, Mao, Hitler, Stalin and other despots. This of course will bring us at war with all his followers that even denied eating flesh from pigs. My bee it’s because they have been so advanced though, that they abandon cannibalism? We don’t know, but it’s likely, a pedophile, sex fixated warlord, is a pig, - no less. 
 That Islam has a lot of common values with all other despots’  in history, tells the fact, that the Mufti  of Jerusalem during Hitler time, moved to Berlin to be with one person of common interest, Murder, rape and rubbery from decent people, just like they do today, by traveling to Europe, just to claim “Dhimmy” from the European people. Making rape legal, because they have been brought up to believe that, European girls are free to take as the like. Racism? We think so, equal to Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. 
 With Islam follows, violence, bombs, killings, war and suppression, Islam has so far not brought anything than problems to the world. Look at the world, wherever there is war Islam is on the one side and mostly on the other too. 
 Devil’s followers, ore Muhammad’s, no difference, will burn in hell as they live on a lei in life, provoking the world to do something about the problem. There are about 1 billion monkeys to many on earth, these spices call themselves Islamist or was it Muslims, and ore, only mislead humans with some permittivity left from the creation? We are not sure.    
 Destroy all Islamist fascists or…. Become a slave!

""" 

  

 As it's said in the wiki article, nothing has been conclusively proven. Yes, you can say that survey found """"black people are bigger on average"""". But It is less credible than the sizesurvey.com survey because of a lack of any information on the Methodology used and other details. It only has the results. So no credibility at all, and of no use in the wikipedia article. I mean they can't even spell. Looks like a page someone quickly made up to attract viewers (searching on """"penis size) to see their sex personal ads plastered all over the place.  

 If you find a better source which details that survey feel free to add it to the others in wiki article. Even then (with methodology details), it probably won't prove anything (being a self-measured study), and will only be useful noting as anecdotal evidence.  

 Same as the sizesurvey.com survey. You used a good quote which shows it's lack of credibility for showing racial size differences (this is already noted in wiki article). But the same is true of the Jakinworld survey. The sample size of Africans was too low to be of use (1.7%). So I would say both the sizesurvey.com survey and the Jakinworld survey are lacking in credibility for comparing racial sizes. I'd say we should either have both in the article (for fairness and neutrality) as weak anecdotal evidence or not have either. It is questionable.    

 Coolnurse.com doesn't even know where the survey information came from. Interesting read, but not credible. 

 If better studies and surveys are done that conclusively show """"black"""" people are larger on average as a whole (race), then yes, that should be published whether """"diet or god gave it to them"""". As of now, studies show too many discrepancies to make any conclusion.  

 Ok. That was a bit of a mind-bender to all contemplate. I think I need to take a break from this article. Penis Penis Penis... Blah Blah.. Heh. Good debate though. Kudos.

 I think we should remove or change it, because it's unencyclopedic as is. The emphasis as is represents some kind of weird fetishistic POV and is not NPOV.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1.6998575925827026

 == Habbo Mafias == 

 I think the article should say more about mafias in habbo because in the UK version having or working in a mafia is one of the most popular things to do. 

 == bandwith required? == 

 What is the required bandwidth needed to use Habbo Hotel?   

 :Dialup is fine, the hotel will take a long time to load but it will function fairly well once it is loaded.  // bornhj   

 == Vandalism == 

 Thanks for locking the article. I believe those that have violated WP:VAN should seriously consider reading up on the standards at Wikipedia.    
 :Bunch of people from 4chan. It's not like they care.   
 :: Nice work ppl.  V's were getting hard to manage.   
 :::I step away from this page for 4 hours, and look what happens! P (Glasnt last edit  9:32 ish)   
 ::::This is why you should edit Wikipedia instead of playing games )    
 :::::Ah, I wasn't playing games. I was working! P. *anyway*   

 Actually, there's a huge raid on habbo (the site not article) today.  People were vandalizing this article because they wanted it locked as a sign of importance.    
 :Is there a credible source on this? I would be interested in reading it. If its there, amend the article to include that at the end?    
 ::ebaumsworld, 4chan's /b/, and encyclopedia dramatica organized the raid.  I don't know if there's a good source.  Goto habbo right now, especially by pools.  That's what people said.    
 ::: Is this related to the Gaia Online blockade that is in a caption, per chance? I think people invest way too much time into this... (er, replace invest with waste)    
 ::::Until there's a credible source that Gaia Online are involved, I've removed the pic. Also, it's a fair use image which doesn't add to the article. It's just vanity on the part of 4chan.  // bornhj   

 #There's no such thing as 4chan 
 #The raiders were from Gaia Online, Ebaum's World, and BlackPlanet.com. Nowhere else.   
 ::Dude. You're obviously being an idiot. And you're overlooking SomethingAwful and Encyclopaedia Dramatica. And I have never heard of blackplanet prior to your insane claim. Also, Gaia's kind of doubtable, since a lot of 4channers are just trolling in attempts to get Gaia in trouble.  
 ::: This raid was planned by 4chan's /b/ and no one else. I won't have ebaum's or fucking Gaia taking our glory. STAND PROUD MY /b/ NIGRA BROTHERS. Go hang out in 4chan.org's random board if you want to see proof. LOLNIGRA 
 ::::I see the Gaia trolls are *still* trying to blame their disgusting crimes on innocent ol' 4chan.   
 ::::: Fuck you. You are not worthy of /b/. A true /b/tard would be proud of his work and not try and blame other sites who don't deserve the credit. LOLNIGRA

 All the articles here about the ethnic groups that have a big diaspora, like Poles, Germans or Italians accept that their country diaspora has a large number of people abroad.

Look, boy: I know women who get off on sadistic nasty gay porn. I know lesbians who get off on cutting each other and drinking the blood. I know women who are sexually aroused by whipping, beating, tormenting, defecating upon, and otherwise abusing other women. I know women who who variously get off on getting choked, getting pissed on, fantasy rape, gang bangs, among many other kinky things, and/or doing the same to others. You clearly think men are 'more perverted' because they have higher testosterone, and now you're becoming a 'proper lady' with your so-called sex reassignment. Bulls**t! Women are just as 'perverted' as men, and I know this from experience! The hormones don't make you female, since you have a body that is biologically MALE on every level. Regardless of what gender quacks who work for the biz say, no 'sex change' will ever make you a real female. The 'female hormones' do not have the same effect on a male brain and body as on a female.

 == Alleged Original Research == 

 I have added back a load of content that was removed supposedly under the reasoning that it was """"original research"""". First, there was reliably sourced content that was removed. The """"Changes in direction"""" section was already reliably sourced as were the quotes. How that falls under original research I'll never know. The show underwent some major changes and to omit that one of the main characters was killed off makes no sense whatsoever. The fact that two of the main stars, John Amos and Esther Rolle, publicly complained about the series and ultimately left because of it also doesn't fall under OR. This was covered by the media as evidenced by the sources that were present. If someone had a problem with Ebony and The LA Times being reliable sources, they should have dropped a note here instead of removing a shit ton of content that someone took the time to write (not me) and another person (me) took the time to source. Original research isn't including details about the work, it's drawing your own conclusions based on your own research. In television show articles, we can use the work itself as a source for the actual details of the show. Once the writing start veering off into overly detailed garbage, that's when the OR police can come out. Works of fiction should have some details about production, ratings, show changes, etc. If not, all we have is an article that say a show aired and some people were in it. It took me all of 20 minutes to find sources for the majority of the removed content - none of it was contentious nor was it OR which means it should not have been removed. Ironically, actual original research about the stupid opening titles was left in.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0,4.046521186828613

 You bet! Here it is: 

 Muslim scholars take this as proof that bahaullah was a decietful liar . If he was the messaih of Islam, he wouldn't take pictures, knowing that it is against Islam. 

 == I didn't do this, But GOOD JOB SIR! == 

 Check this edit out! I give my thanks to whoever did it! 

 The Truth About Bahaullah 

 He was a liar according to everybody in the world. He is promised Hell Fire in the following religions: 
 ::1. Islaam (He lied and he knew he was a liar)  
 ::2. Judaism (He preached against Yahweh)  
 ::3. Christianity (He pretended to be Jesus)  
 ::4. Hinduism (He ate meat)  
 ::5. Jainism (He killed living creatures)  
 ::6. Atheists (He was mentally retarted) 

 So, it is safe to say that one men who will definately'' be in Hell is Bahá'u'lláh!

 == [citation needed] == 

 I had read somewhere that essentially many people that didn't have positive interactions with their caregivers in early childhood, only negative ones (heavy beatings could be one) become sadists and/or masochists. They have no choice but to love such parent(s) (they have no other options, unless this is a commune) so they confuse hurting with helping and get effed up arousal/romance styles. Like knives/electricity/burning/hanging/mutilation/crotch attacks/feces eating/slavery/butt fucking till the anus bleeds, or, in milder cases, lower amounts of suffering. (spectrum between normal romantic/sex relationships and inability to form them) This almost makes too much sense to need citation but (typical of """"people sciences"""") Googling """"causes of masochism"""" shows only hypotheses and this is not one of them. However, there are citations for at least 30% of child abuse victims abusing their children and masochists outnumbering sadists. And some sadists probably want to abuse their children but don't cause consenting masochists won't get them in trouble. I hypothesize that the relatively small S&M; research community's laissez faire-ness and inability to feel that Orwellian reversal of the injury-prevention drive of self preservation is perverse causes it to not think of this. Also the Google hits are all copied from what appears to be the DSM. Psychiatrists are often cold people who analyse humans like objects and many S&Ms; say giving pain is love (again the good is bad, bad is good Newspeak thing again) so a love-based theory is not really in their personality toolkit. 

 (Psychiatry is also almost the study of fucked up-ness (a guy who's vertical 24/7 — thinks he's a spillable glass of juice, afraid of people drinking him, lol) they must be jaded to effed up ppl..)  

 Anyway, the DSM hypotheses seem wishy-washy to me compared to the one I support (Freud's ones usually do too, and look how those turned out). Shouldn't there be a version of Occam's Razor that says that the social sciences theory that seems least mushy to non-wishy washy doctorates is most likely to be correct? 

 If I was misinterpreted, my main point was that I don't want to experience an intercourse that's more pleasurable than regular intercourse. I want to retain the ability to have intercourse with different kinds of people without it being second-best, not just the kinkier than average. 

 Also, I'm aware that women have different thresholds where pain starts and anus tightnesses and it doesn't hurt some. And that some female prostates are more sensitive than others. I'd still be concerned if she's 5'0"""" and being/practically demanding me to """"pound my ass faster!"""". I'm now reminded that I generally fantasized anal sex with adult girls in 5th grade because I thought it was fairer. You know, a penis size to anus width thing. Peer girls were hotter, I imagined them with unusually loose anuses.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0,2.235367774963379

There's no need to dismiss someone like that, not because we're all looking for the fainting couch but because it's designed to be maximally dismissive and provocative. You told someone they weren't worth listening to in the first comment. It's completely fine to tell someone their opinion needs to be backed up with evidence but there's no reason to do so like you did. It demeans any sense of level debate and coarsens things needlessly. Sure, if someone is pissing you off or not getting the point, responding like you did would be perfectly reasonable!

But you seemed to assume that posture the instant someone made an assertion you didn't like. If they felt they were making a reasonable contribution to the discussion (a comment such as theirs is pretty common in RfCs and elsewhere), then what were they to think when you reacted as you did? Should they have thanked you for your implicit education in how tough the real world is by comparison? Maybe leaving the discussion or ignoring the slight is easier. I certainly understand why people you've treated like crap wouldn't readily confront you about it. What would they gain from doing so? All I'm saying is don't be a jerk.

"""Bad Etymology== 
 The paragraph says: 

 Although the ultimate origin of the word """"slut"""" is unknown, it first appeared in Middle English in 1402 as slutte (AHD), with the meaning """"a dirty, untidy, or slovenly woman"""".[5] Even earlier, Geoffrey Chaucer used the word sluttish (c. 1386) to describe a slovenly man; however, later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women.[5] The modern sense of """"a sexually promiscuous woman"""" dates to at least 1450/ 

 Now the first sentence says it FIRST appeared in 1402 but the second says EVEN EARLIER Chaucer used the word in 1386. Well then the FIRST use would have to be at least 1386 not the other way around.

 == The Term """"Dick Joke"""" Used Figuratively == 
 In private conversations among professional comedians, I've heard the term """"dick joke"""" get used to refer to any facile dumb humor that gets dropped in, as dumb *as if* it were literally just dick jokes.  Example: In the middle of a conversation with a good and sustained level of humor, someone drops in some just distractingly stupid joke, and then being told """"dammit!, why do you always have to go right to the dick joke!?"""" (when the joke in question wasn't an actual dick joke at all, just dumb and vulgar). Or: """"(some name) is a HACK He goes up and does eight minutes of dick jokes and he calls that a set!"""" (...where that might not involve *any* actual dick jokes, but humor about no smarter than a bunch of dick jokes.)  Ironically, this entry's example of a dick joke """"A professor gives his psychology class a spot quiz..."""" wouldn't count as a dick joke in the sense I'm talking about too much setup, and not broad enough... at all.  Also, about as funny as a glacier.  Anyway, for my sense of """"dick joke"""", I have no citation whatsoever it has come up repeatedly in conversation as a term of jargon, but I'm not putting it in this entry, because, like I say, no citation.  But, folks, keep listening, because maybe the sense I'm talking about will show up in some comedian's podcast or something.

"""==IDKFA== 

 The meaning of this is unclear.  It is variously described as 
 ID Kicks Fucking Ass, or ID Killer Full Ammo.  I went back 
 to the original Doom source ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/doomsrc.zip 
 to see if I could resolve this.  Indeed the comments in st_stuff.c 
 give definitions for these cheat codes: 

 IDFA is commented as: 

  // 'fa' cheat for killer fucking arsenal 

 IDKFA on the other hand is commented as: 

  // 'kfa' cheat for key full ammo 

 So it looks like """"ID Kicks Fucking Ass"""" is apocryphal.

 :I was not being rude at all.  Calling you a shit-eating, uncle-fucking donkey rapist, that would have been rude, but I have not done that. 

 :As to Cyprus, I am not sure what that has to do with Islam at all.  Turkey is a secular state. 

 :But none of this matters here.  If you want to discuss pros and cons of Islam, the political developments in Cyrprus, etc., there is Usenet and a bzillion discussion forums that you can use.  The Wikipedia is not a discussion forum. 

 :You may want to familiarize yourself with the concept of NPOV.  The purpose of the Wikipedia is not presenting """"objective truth"""" (which is more elusive than some people realize), but a presentation of available knowledge on the subject from the neutral point of view. 

 :So, the following is not NPOV:

 :Neither is this: 

 :""""Muslims are bloodthirsty maniacs who delightly in killing infidels, especially women and children.""""

 :""""According to CAIR and so-and-so and such-and-such, and other prominent Muslim theologians, Islam forbids attacks on civilian targets, and any attacks on civilians in the name of Islam are contrary to teachings of Islam.  However, according to Daniel Pipes, they are really apologists for terrorism, who half-heartedly condemn it strictly for PR purposes."""" 

 :""""The issue is further complicated by whats-his-name, who takes the view that attacks against civilian targets are permitted if they are in retaliation for enemy's attack on one's own civilian targets.  The extent to which this view represents the views of Muslims is in dispute.  According to Daniel Pipes, 95% of all Muslims think this.  But according to Prof. Dorkenburger, professor of Religious Studies at the University of Utana and author of 'You are an intolerant bastard', Daniel Pipes is an intolerant bastard."""" 

 :Daniel Pipes, Prof. Dorkenburger, Usama bin Laden, and people from CAIR could all read the above and agree that it describes the situation accurately.  This would not require them to agree on whether or not Mr. Pipes is an intolerant bastard, whether or not CAIR is lying through its teeth, whether or not Prof. Dorkenburger has the slightest clue, or whether or not the people in the WTC deserved to die.

I wasn’t in a black or mixed race family, so I had no experience of racism. But still, I was different.” He was so young at the time.

 What is to prevent me from going ahead with the very sinister plan of making a program that connects to Wikipedia pages, vandalizes them, and simply resets my modem to a new IP address every time it gets blocked from editing?  You feeble HUMANS take five freakin' minutes to fix a single g*d damn vandalization, but a program could vandalize faster than you can say """"Oh, I'm a casual Wikipedia user reading all of this crap and I'm never going to use Wikipedia again.""""

In that time, people will have ALREADY started reading the vandalizations.  Hence I get my way. 

 Now, I'm not going to mess around with the text that's already there.  I respect the purpose of Wikipedia to provide an open community for everyone to contribute to make a constructive web site, and I don't want to undermine the information that is already on the pages.

 == Re:X Japan == 

 I'll take another look and leave my comments on the talk page for the article.  But first, I've got a couple things that I noticed at the first look: 

 I've got no problem with first-party sources, WP:SELFPUB says that's okay. As long as it's relevant and the article doesn't fully rely on them, it's ok.  If you've fixed the linking problem for every source that I had the first time I looked, then you should be fine.  I know finding sources might be difficult, but I've done it before with another article that seemed even more impossible (read Crush 40, that was nearly impossible to source the style section).  Also, I seriously doubt you'll get enough out of the article for four samples, cut it down to one or two and you should be fine as long as you write good fair use rationales and connections to the text.  You could work the samples into the history section, but you'd need to explain in the text how that particular song is relevant and the sample is used in an encyclopedic manner.   

 Best of luck, I'll take another look later tonight, I've got some work I have to take care of first.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.505122184753418

  Hello Mansi45, and welcome to Wikipedia.  While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here. 

 *You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here. 
 *Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research.  
 *Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste.  
 *If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials. 
 *In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow. 
 *Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia. 

 It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing.

"""   Given how juicy and sweet wolfberries are, it would probably be impossible to have a pesticide-free farm. There is little hard information on this topic, though. One development I learned recently is that Chinese wolfberry farmers  if so motivated  can contract with US-approved organic certifiers who must visit the farm in China to perform their qualification tests. This is expensive and has been discouraging. 

 I have a bottle of the Young Living wolfberry juice called NingxiaRed (www.ningxiared.com). It has a label stating """"Certified Organic"""". 

 On another hand, however, China issues its Green Certificate to some wolfberry farmers in Ningxia, a certification that is likely """"as best as possible"""" assuring pesticide practices have been reasonable and minimal as possible. My guess is that is the best one can do given the sweetness of this fruit on the vine (attracts pollinators and pests of all kinds). 

 Serious wolfberry product marketers in the US can have their products tested for pesticide levels. I have seen the lab results from one in Seattle that shows negligible levels in their dried berries and pulp or juice powders. I have not seen these results on the various wolfberry juice products on the US market.

In response to what you have said: I know that stealware and browser hijacking aren't exactly the same thing, which is why I qualified my remarks by saying that it *might* fall under the umbrella of browser hijacking, in case someone wanted to come along and give a definitive confirmation one way or the other. ;-) 

 ::At any rate, here is an excerpt from the earlier revision to explain why I thought there was some confusion involved:  

  
 :::""""This software modifies the browser's behavior with respect to some- or all domains. It modifies the url submitted to the server to profit from a given  affiliate scheme by the content provider of the given domain."""" 

  
 ::Therein lies the confusion. The definition above is so broad that it is really more a definition of """"browser hijacking"""" than it is of """"stealware"""" and could easily be intepreted as such. Stealware is definitely more specific than something that """"modifies URLs"""" and """"browser behavior"""". In fact, unless I'm not mistaken it refers to a type of theft that occurs in which commission that would have been earned by a web site through an affiliate scheme is stolen by someone else through the fradulent replacement of a cookie in the user's browser.  

  
 ::Because the original definition under this section sounded like the one for browser hijacking, I could only assume that the label of """"URL Injection"""" was purely accidental and was supposed to be """"Browser Hijacker"""" instead. (Either that, or the person who did this section really meant to write about URL Injection, but wrote a poor definition of it). Adding to the confusion was what appeared to be a glaring omission of """"Browser Hijacking"""" from the table of contents, since it's one of the most prevalent types of malware around. Since the definition of """"URL Hijacking"""" matched it perfectly, I only assumed that this section was about it, but that it was simply mislabeled. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.540015697479248

 :::::::::::It's not really correct to say that under the Australian Constitution New Zealand has the """"right"""" or even """"an invitation"""" to join the Commonwealth of Australia. A """"right"""" would imply that NZ can join regardless of the Australian attitude to this  and this simply isn't the case. During the initial stages of planning for federation, the possibility of NZ joining was a real one. But by the time the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act was enacted by the Westminster Parliament in 1900, the possibility of NZ joining the Commonwealth of Australia as an original state was no longer realistic. But since NZ was right next door and had a relatively small population it was still possible that NZ (along with other nearby British possessions such as some of the islands in the Western Pacific) would wish to join at a future date. The preamble reflects this by stating: """"Whereas the people of [the current Australian states] have agreed to unite ... and whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the Commonwealth of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen"""". This just states the political reality of the time that (in the eyes of the British Government it was """"expedient"""" (made sense!) for other nearby British colonies to jump on the bandwagon. One large British colony is easier to administer  not to mention is more capable of defending itself than several small ones. NZ does, however, get explicit mention in one of the covering clauses. The definition of """"the states"""" in covering clause 6 includes reference to NZ. If you read this carefully it does not say that NZ *is* a state of the Commonwealth or even that it *has the right to become* a state.  Rather it simply says that if it did join then it would be a state for the purposes of the Australian Constitution. Since it didn't join at the time of Federation the only possibility of NZ joining is now under Chapter VI of the Constitution which deals with the admission or establishment of new states. If NZ wanted to join, it would  along with anyone else who wanted to join  have to do so according to the provisions of s 121 which states that """"The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent or representation in either House of Parliament, as it thinks fit"""". That's not a right. It's entirely up to the Australian Parliament whether NZ  or anyone else for that matter  can join. But again, the chances of NZ joining now are of course almost non-existent.

 :Sancho himself, and his ancestors, called themselves kings of Pamplona, not of Navarre. That is the way they appear in medieval charters. It was not until Sancho VI that the kings started to be known as Kings of Navarre. One of the best biographies on Sancho III was written by Gonzalo Martínez Díez, and the title of the book is Sancho III el Mayor, rey de Pamplona, Rex Ibericus. First chapter of the book: """"Orígenes del Reino de Pamplona"""" and on p. 17 of that chapter:  """"En esas montañas del norte de España surgirán diversos focos de resistencia (a los musulmanes) que darán lugar al nacimiento de los futuros reinos cristianos, los cinco reinos de España de la época medieval, uno de los cuales será el núcleo del reino de Pamplona primero y de Navarra más tarde"""". I could come up with more sources to back this, not just Gonzalo Mtz Díez.  It would be as misleading to call him King of Navarre as if we called Fernán González King of Castile when at that time, Castile was a county which would later give rise to the Kingdom of Castile. And the reason nobody complained when the article was moved prior to your move was that the user who did so, is one of the main contributors to this article and I agreed with the move.

 page, then - since it is your page - you should feel free to change or delete them.   
 Alternatively, if you have different views on some aspect of the topic, 
 but still are willing to acknowledge the potential relevance of some of the 
 information that I've added, perhaps you wish to moved my additions to some 
 other section of your page, or supplement it with additional information of your own, 
 or indicate that there is disagreement on some aspect of it. 

 I acknowledge that many of the points that I brought up on the topic of differential diagnosis are quite straightforward, but I think that they are still relevant and 
 useful. 

 Some of the other points - regarding the use of Bayes rule to rigorously use 
 conditioning information (such as risk factors) to evaluate the likelihood 
 of various diagnoses - is unfortunately not known by many practioners -  
 although it is actually the theoretically most correct way of evaluating 
 and using such risk data. 

 The other point regarding cognitive biases in medical decision making 
 is a very important one, and has been the subject of over 25 years of 
 research at many top Universities (like Stanford and U.C. Berkeley). 
 I urge you to take a look at some of the biases on the list of cognitive biases, 
 particularly availability bias, representativeness bias, ignoring bases rates, optimistic overconfidence bias, and a whole host of other very well researched biases that have 
 a ongoing profound impact on clinical decision making. 

 Perhaps it would be best if these would be moved to a different subsection  
 of the page, and you should certainly feel free to do so, or if you 
 give me permission, I would be happy to do so.

Since McCain was campaigning with his adopted Bangladeshi daughter, an image quickly gathered around that statement.

 With the bucket as shown on the Bobcat  you can load, dump, dig, grade, carry, etc. It makes for an excellent oversized wheelbarrow, particularly when there is are one or more extra persons to load the bucket. 

 With the pallet forks, you have an all terrain forklift, but they are good for so much more than just pallets! The forks are positionable from between six inches apart, to the full width of the attachment.  

 Pushed close together they can break up dirt when digging holes in hard ground making the task much faster than with hand tools alone (strictly speaking this is what a small excavator attachment is for, but you work with what you have.) 
 Great for starting small holes in hard ground when planting trees. 
 Just the other day I used the forks in this configuration to quickly and easily remove some medium shrubs that we wanted to transplant.

Although both can be traded in either transactional or sequential markets, only knowledge can be changed in a meaningful way with each transaction.  Further, we use Web 1.0 group sites for exchanging information and Web 2.0 social networking sites for jointly creating knowledge.

 I sort of think there needs to be some kind of resolution to the fighting over this article. This log is beyond absurd: and, more to the point, when I've seen similar protection logs the dispute(s) has/have usually ended up going to ArbCom. That's not something I imagine anyone wants. Arbitrators have limited patience too. 

 As far as further disputes go, I really can't imagine what there is left to fight over. From the point of view of someone (more or less) on the outside, who's never seen the film, and, in all honesty, doesn't give two flying fucks about it either - this article is not that bad. Ok, so not FA-standard, nor A-class, or whatever, but Wikipedia has far worse trash for you to go out there and fix. Ok, so that """"academic reception"""" stuff is, at least in my opinion, a bit too long, though the film  obviously does have some notable critics (Mr Dawkins). But, hey, it's a New Age film - when we write an encyclopaedia article on such a topic, we should probably use a slightly different language-game than we would in an article on mainstream science. And, be realistic - there is no need to explicitly keep on hammering out the fact the science in the film is tosh. Most people will click on those links to the Ramtha School and JZ Knight articles. Those who don't, you won't persuade anyway. . 

 In conclusion: this article is not a perfect model of NPOV. Big deal - not. Wikipedia has far worse articles. This one is, by and large, ok. Maybe at some future stage we can come back and trim a little bit of the criticism, which is, at least in my opinion, excessive. But the unwavering obsession some people appear to have with this article is totally unwarranted. It's reasonably fair, both to fans of the film and to those who hate it. Is there any need to keep on with the quarrels and edit-wars? I warn you - if you do keep going, and this does go to arbitration, I suspect the arbitrators' reactions will be far from pleasant, particularly since some of the names of the chaps fighting here have come up in previous cases.

 :See page two of the NSW Monthly Weather Review which states In the first two days of the month, a monsoonal low pressure system over inland Queensland brought high rainfall to the northern regions of the state. This moved south over the following days, bringing strong falls in western regions, before interacting with a low pressure trough on the 7th. The resultant system brought very heavy rainfall to the southern half of the state between the 7th and 8th, particularly in the Riverina region. (Synoptic summary)

 Thanks for your message on my talk page about . I have blocked the account indefinitely. It may help to give you a few words of advice about how to handle cases like this in future. It took me a very long time to find evidence that the edits really were vandalism, and then more time to convince me that the account was a sock puppet. Many admins would simply not have that much time available to spend on checking a case. You said """"The admins too much pity on him"""", but it is quite possible that they simply didn't see enough evidence to justify blocking. You would be more likely to get results if you gave some evidence. For example, Hayvan put at London Heathrow Airport that Turkish Airlines runs flights from Heathrow to Esenboga International Airport, Ankara. Eventaully I found http://www.heathrowairport.com/flight-information/destinations-and-airlines, which told me that this was not true. However, I rarely have any reason to check airline details, so at first I didn't know where to look, and wasted a lot of time looking in the wrong places. Clearly you have a knowledge of this subject, so you could probably have easily given a few URLs such as that one, which would have immediately shown that the edits were vandalism. Likewise, it is likely that you could have given reasons for thinking that the account was a sockpuppet.

  performed a heavy editing cut on this article, referring to it as a cleanup. Had to revert it since it was a deletionist cut off of focused/main info. 

 * Pinout comparison: Pinout diagram shows the main differences between PC and NC. Flatting the diagram colors doesn't really make it more expressive. 
 * External links: There are worldwide only a few emulators manufacturers. It would be strange, talking about hw emulators, not to link to them. 
 * Floppy interfaces: You can't simply understand practical hw emulatiion if you don't understand the main floppy interfaces. 
    

 :* The point of Wikipedia is to present knowledge here. External links should be used sparingly for information which can be found elsewhere which cannot be included here for whatever reason. They are not to be used for general portal links. This goes doubly when you quite evidently control at least one of said links, and trebly when said link is to a page where you make money from selling the linked product. All of those links should be removed again. 
 :* The """"floppy interfaces"""" comment is presumably due to the alteration of the heading """"FDC interface"""" to """"interface"""". There was no actual removal of information there. It most certainly did not warrant a flat revert under a """"vandalism"""" summary. That one at least doesn't need to be reverted right now, although the article still needs completely rewritten and the headings will undoubtedly change again during that process. 
 :* The current table layout is completely unreadable. Quite aside from massive overuse of HTML (about 4kb of pointless markup all told), coloured headers would be far less useful than, say, adequate labelling of the data. For now, it's easy enough to cut down on the junk markup without actually altering the table layout, though again the whole thing will probably need completely rewritten. 
 :* Obviously the most galling thing here is an editor with an obvious conflict of interest reverting good-faith edits as vandalism, though the petty swipe at """"deletionists"""" didn't help either. This obviously needs attention from an editor with good technical knowledge and good English to progress further at this time, though I'll try to reincorporate those changes which shouldn't ce controversial now that Blackvisionit has been warned.

 == Controversy? == 

 There isn't any past conversation / controversy that I can see on the discussion page (I'm still new, so I might be missing something), so I'm wondering what the controversy is about?  The first map, obviously from CIA Factbook, is the map used for about 90% of country pages that I've noticed so far (probably because it's from a US Government source, it's not copyrighted and a Godsend for Wikipedians) so why should the Namibia map be different? 

 The only difference I can see (other than quality) is that the larger map shows administrative areas (apparently) and some more towns.  If that's the reason people want the second map included, then I saw include both.  If there's an inaccuracy to the (currently-shown) Factbook map, just use the second one.

 ==balance== 
 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

 == Please do not hastily remove sections == 

 SummerPhd, 

 I noticed you removed my section on coconut oil. I understand that I did not give an explanation for removing some content, so let me explain: 

 First, I'm new to editing articles on Wikipedia and this was my first edit, so I missed the explaination section at the bottom of the page. I noticed that some significant modifications have been made to some pages regarding foods that you might find in health food stores, some of which are completely unfounded. For example, deleting information regarding nutritional composition, or studies linking foods to particular health effects, seems to be some kind of info war to me. If you or others who delete these sections feel that the issue is not so black and white, then additional content needs to placed to challenge those studies, rather than removing the content entirely. 

 The section I removed seemed to me to read as biased. The section reads: 

 """"Many health organizations advise against the consumption of coconut oil due to its high levels of saturated fat, including ..."""" (and then a list of organizations are listed).  

 First of all, none of those references make any statements advising against the consumption of coconut oil, they only talk about limiting saturated fat. If you read the section on saturated fat, you would notice that the issue is not that cut and dry. In fact, some studies show that <7% SFA and TFA may have a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. The actual picture may be more complicated, and ratios of saturated, mono and polyunsaturated fats may be more important than actual levels of these fats, but this is mere conjecture to me that I am not interested in defending. Although it is not that cut any dry, I still maintain that caution should be taken with the consumption of saturated fats. There is enough data to suggest that, although the picture is much more complex than we originally thought, there may be good reason to limit saturated fat intake. But completely removing a macronutrient from your diet may have unintended consequences, which is probably why none of these agencies advocate a complete elimination of saturated fat, but to maintain low levels of it.  

 I did not see listing all of those agencies as necessary. It appeared to read like a biased article, and in order to eliminate the feeling I had that it felt biased, I still kept the original argument but in a more succinct fashion with the references in tact: 

 """"Since lauric acid is a saturated fat, moderation is recommended by many health organizations, which advise a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats."""" (I included all of the original citations at the end of this sentence). 

 Nevertheless, instead of restoring the old content in addition to mine, you completely removed my content, despite it containing a good amount of studies, some from notable journals. And the content I wrote was not particularly regarding saturated fat and it's controversy, but instead, it mentioned the antimicrobial effects of MCTs and monolaurin. If you feel that there is some debate in some of the findings that I presented, you should instead include those in the article, rather than completely removing my edit. 

 I hope this explains things for you, SummerPhd. Please be less hasty about deleting content on Wikipedia, many people rely on it to learn about complex issues. If you feel that the section is biased, please mention how. If you feel that it's more complicated, please explain and cite your reasons with sources from journals. Readers have a right to make up their own minds about these subjects, and wikipedia is all about shedding light on all the complex dimensions of our world, not merely maintaining a one-sided argument. 
 :The article you are editing, coconut oil, has been through a few heated debates, including both edit warring and sockpuppetry.

"سوال ۱۰ 
 سوال ۱۰ ۔ کیا اُم المومنین حضرت عائشہؓ کا مولاعلیؑ کے مقابل خروج حق تھا؟ 
 مستند روایات سے پتہ چلتا ہے کہ مولا علیؑ اور حضرت عائشہؓ کے مابین مخاصمت واقعہ افک کے بعد سے ہی شروع ہوگئی تھی جو کہ بڑھتے بڑھتے عداوت اختیار کہ گئی۔ دورانِ واقعہ افک حضوراکرمؐ نے غمغین حالت میں مولا علی ؑ سے مشورہ کیا تو مولا نے آپ کو غم و اضطراب سے بچانے کے لئے یہ مشورہ دیا کہ اللہ تعالیٰ نے آپ پر کچھ تنگی نہیں فرمائی اگر افواہوں کی بنا پر عائشہؓ کی طرف سے کچھ تکرر طبعی ہو گیا ہے تو عورتیں اور بہت ہیں۔ علاوہ ازیں آپ کا یہ تکرار اس طرح بھی رفع ہو سکتا ہے کہ بریرہؓ جو صدیقہ عائشہؓ کی کنیز ہیں۔ اُن سے اُنکے حالات کی تحقیق فرما لیجئے‘‘۔ مولا علیؑ کے اس مشورہ کا حضرت عائشہؓ کو بھی پتہ چل گیا تھا جس کی وجہ سے صدیقہ دِلی طور پر مولا ؑ سے ناخوش تھیں۔ 
 ہادی برحقؐ کی رحلت کے بعد مولا علی ؑ نے چھ ما ہ تک خلیفہ اول سے بیعت نہ کی۔ اِس دوران مسئلہ فدک بھی پیش آیا جس میں حضرت عائشہؓ نے سیدہ فاطمہؓ اور مولا علی ؑ کا بھی ساتھ نہ دیا اور اپنے والد حضرت ابو بکرؓ کی روایت کردہ حدیث کی تصدیق بھی کی۔مجھے مفتی صاحب کی اس بات سے قطعی طور پر اختلاف ہے کہ خلیفہ اول کے دور حکومت میں مولا علیؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کے لئے کھڑیاں اس لئے جمع کی گئیں تھیں کیونکہ گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی جمع ہوگئے تھے۔ 

 سبحان اللہ مفتی صاحب ایک طرف آپ فرما رہے ہیں کہ حضرت عائشہ کے گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ بھی بلا اذن داخل نہیں ہو سکتے تھے دوسری طرف آپ مولا علی ؑ کے گھر میں منافقین جمع ہونے کی خبر دے ر ہے ہیں۔ آپ کا یہ بیان کیا متضاد نہیں؟ کیا مولا کا گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ نہیں تھا؟ اپنی اس غلط بیانی پر ذرا خودی غور فرمائیے۔ نیز جن کو آپ مولا علی کے گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی کہہ رہے ہیں ان میں چند صحابہ کرام مثلاً حضرت عباسؓ بن عبد المطلب، حضرت زبیرؓ ،حضرت طلحہٰ، حضرت مقدارؓ ، حضرت سعد بن ابی وقاص اور خود مولا علیؑ بھی شامل تھے۔ نیز سیدہ فاطمۃ الزھرہؓ و حضرت حسنین ؑ بھی گھر میں موجود تھے ۔ لہٰذہ کیا مولا ؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے والے ارباب اختیا ر حضور اکرمؐ کی وصیت بھی بھول چکے تھے جس میں صحابہ کرام ؓ کو تلقین کی گئی تھی کہ میرے شہزادوں کا احترام ، محبت اور تعظیم کرنا۔ 

 ان سب واقعات کے وقوع پذیر ہونے کے باوجود یہ سوال اٹھتا ہے کہ کیا مولا علیؑ اتنے بے بس اور لاچار تھے کہ لوگ ان کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کا پروگرام بنا رہے ہوں اور مولا ؑ خاموش ہیں؟ جواب میں عرض ہے کہ مولاؑ نہ تو خوفزدہ اور نہ ہی لاچار تھے۔ بھلا یہ کیسے ممکن ہے کہ جنگ اخزاب اور جنگ خیبر کا فاتح ایسے موقع پر خوفزدہ ہو۔ اصل بات مولا ؑ کی دور اندیش اور حضور اکرم ؐ کی آخری لمحات میں مولا ؑ کی گود میں وصیت تھی ’’علی میرے بعد تجھے مکر و ہات سے پالا پڑے گا تو دل تنگ نہ کرنا اورصبر کرنا‘‘حضورؐ کی یہ وصیت مولا کے لئے پتھر پر لکیر تھی پھر بھلا صبر کا دامن کیسے چھوڑ دیتے! 
 لکھنے والوں نے تو بہت کچھ لکھا ہے بلکہ لکھوایا گیا ہے۔ لیکن مولا ؑ چونکہ علم دھبی جو اللہ تعالیٰ کی طرف سے حضور اکرمؐ کے توسط سے ودیعت ہوا تھا سے بہتر طور پر سمجھ سکتے تھے کہ مناسب کیا ہے اورکیا نا مناسب ہے ۔ یہی وجہ تھی کہ مولا ؑ نے خلیفہ اول سے خلیفہ ثالث تک پورا پورا تعاون کیا۔ 

 اب ہم آتے ہیں اصل سوال کی طرف کہ کیا اُم المومنین حضرت عائشہؓ کا مولا علیؓ کے مقابل خروج حق پر مبنی تھا؟ 
 اس سوال کا جواب بہت تفصیل طلب ہے۔ مختصراً عرض کردوں کہ ماں جی تمام امھات المومنین سے زیادہ علم رکھتی تھیں۔ آپ نے قرآن پاک کی مندرجہ ذیل آیات بھی یقناًپڑھی ہونگی:۔ 
 ۱:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۶)۔ ترجمہ: نبیؐ مومنوں کے ساتھ خود ان کے نفس سے بھی زیادہ تعلق رکھتے ہیں۔ اور آپؐ کی بی بیاں ان کی ما یں ہیں۔ 
 ۲:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۳۱-۳۲)۔ ترجمہ: 	  ۳۱  اے نبی کی بی بیو تم معمولی عورتوں کی طرح نہیں اگر تم تقویٰ اختیار کرو۔ ۳۲: اور تم اپنے گھروں میں قرار سے رہو۔ 
 مذکورہ بالا احکام کی روشنی میں ممکن ہے حضرت عائشہؓ نے صحابہ کو تلقین کی ہو لیکن زیادہ احتمال یہی ہے کہ دیرنہ عدوات جو کہ انسانی فطرت ہے اورمشیروں کے غلط مشوروں سے خروج ہوا۔ ماں جی کو یقین تھا کہ مولا ؑ قاتلانِ عثمان میں شامل نہیں ہیں بلکہ مولا علیؑ نے آخری دم تک ؟؟؟؟ اپنے شہزادوں کے حضرت عثمانؓ کا ساتھ دیا۔ حضرت عائشہؓ ایک عالمہ فا ضلہ ام المومنین تھیں ایک عرصہ حضور اکرمؐ کر قربت میں گزارہ تھا اور اس پر فخر بھی کیا کرتی تھیں۔ 
 آپکے علم میں یہ دو حدیثیں تو ضرور ہونگی جن کا مفہوم یہ ہے:۔ 
 ۱: اے علی میرے بعد تمہارے ساتھ یہ اُمت دعا کرے گی تم میری ملت پر زندہ رہو گے۔ (کنز العمال علی متقی الجز سادس ۱۰۷۲) 
 ۲: 	 اے عائشہؓ میرے بعد تم ایک گروہ کی قیادت کرو گی جو نا حق ہو گا۔ مقام خواب پر تمہاری اونٹنی پر کتے بھونکیں گے۔ 
 ۳: 	 حضرت عمار بن یاسر کو ایک باغی گروہ قتل کرے گا۔ 
 اتنی واضح احادیث ہوتے ہوئے بھی مولا علیؑ کے خلاف خروج چہ معنی دارد۔ پھر مولاؑ بھی وہ جن کی شان شیخ سعدیؒ نے فرمایا۔ 
 بعدازمصطفےٰ در کل عالم 	  نہ بُد فاضل ترو بہتر ز حیدر ؑ 
 بہر حال ماں جی نے خروج جن حالات اورجس وجہ سے کیا ظاہری تو ایک فطری عداوت ہی لگتی ہے۔ ورنہ مائیں تو اولاد کو صُلح و امن کا ہی مشورہ دیتی ہیں البتہ انکے خروج سے نہ صرف جنگ جمل ظہور پذیر ہوئی بلکہ جنگِ صفین، واقعہ حُرہ، سانحہٰ کربلا اور نہ جانے کتنے فتنے برپا ہوئے اور ہوتے رہیں گے۔یقیناً ماں جی کو اس حدیث مبارکہ کا بھی علم ہوگا جس میں حضور اکرمؐ نے فرمایا ’’عنقریب میرے اہل بیت میرے بعد میری اُمت سے قتل و غارت دیکھیں گے اور ہمارے سب سے زیادہ بغض رکھنے والے دشمن بنو اُمیہ، بنو المغیرہ و بنو مخدوم ہونگے (حدیث صحیح بخاری باب الفتن نمبر ۷)۔ ‘‘

 : Cruise is an actor  rich and popular, yes, but still an actor. His job is to imitate or pretend, to simulate. This has not the importance of, say, a common emergency room physician, whose job it is to save lives and relieve suffering. Granted, Cruise entertains  not well, perhaps, but with some ability. Yet even as an actor he is poor. He is not merely poor in skill; he is poor as a human being, lacking depth and perspective. Even Leonardo DiCaprio, who previously held the chair of pretty face idiot, has matured somewhat, while Cruise has merely gotten old and still has no more dimension than a sheet of paper. Add to this the fact that Cruise is a Scientology nutcase and you are forced to see that anything he might say unscripted is utterly worthless chatter.  

 : Next, consider Holmes, who has never done any work of quality  a professional cipher, at best a pretty woman (of which there are more than are notable). Her marriage to Cruise is the most prominent item on her resume. It is impossible to gain any insight into the human condition by gazing into this shallow saucer.  

 : Unite these two and  as is entirely routine  an offspring results. They have done absolutely nothing else together of even slight interest. You cannot convince me that jumping on a couch on teevee is deviant, interesting, unusual, noteworthy, or in any way deserving of discussion (and in any case, the two did not do this together). Now, if the man doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire, yes, I might watch that and want to know why. The child herself is an infant, has done nothing whatever that rates a single glyph, anywhere outside of her parents' hearts.  

 : The single notable phenomenon which this article raises is common to a great range of media """"personalities""""  people generally without any real personality who have good press agents and a talent for high-profile temper tantrums. Paris Hilton comes to mind. Such people milk the publicity industry to create a spurious flurry of interest. In Cruise's case, I grant that his career has been sufficient to grant him notability on his own; I'll tolerate Holmes on the same level as South Fremont High School of St. Anthony, Idaho  this is touted as an encyclopedia, so let it be encyclopedic.  

 : The couple (or family), however, is nothing apart from its members. The words on this page, to whatever extent they do not apply to, or cannot be merged into, individual articles has value only inasmuch as the topic of mediacruft is explored, examined, and discussed.

 ::Okay, so here's my two cents: 
 :# This not an NPOV issue, but a sourcing issue. If it were an NPOV issue, then no matter what the source said, our wording itself would have been the problem. 
 :# The original wording was an explicit abuse of the source, since the claim was about discrimination but the cited source made no reference whatsoever to discrimination. 
 :# The cited source also was not about ethnic issues; the CIA World Factbook has a set format listing """"ethnic groups"""", but in Japan's case (where the census doesn't collect data on ethnic/racial background) subs nationality in instead. Proof of this can be seen in their citing """"Chinese"""" as an ethnic group on the Japan page, but on the China page actual ethnicities are listed. They even went out of their way to cite what ethnic data they could  that a large proportion of the Brazilian population were ethnic Japanese. That's also why the source didn't refer to """"Yamato Japanese"""". 
 :# The source cited is actually not the CIA World Factbook but a mirror site that claims its information to be """"accurate as of August 23, 2014"""", but it's pretty obvious that this doesn't mean it is """"accurate to the real world as of August 23, 2014"""" but rather that it is an """"accurate representation of the CIA World Factbook as of August 23, 2014"""". This is problematic when the Factbook itself is not necessarily up-to-date (the only date given in the cited statistics is 2004, and I think it's safe to assume that, for example, a more up-to-date figure for the contraceptive prevalence rate can be found than the 2005 figure of 54.3%). 
 :# For this reason and the above point (3) that for unavoidable formatting reasons the Factbook gives misleading information about the ethnic situation in Japan, I don't think the Factbook should be cited in this article. 
 :# The current wording is still problematic, since, even though it does not directly make the same unsourced claim, the citing (without specific explanation) of census data on nationality in an article on ethnic issues is misleading and problematic. 
 :#The sentence as originally worded made a(n unsubstantiated) claim that non-Japanese face discrimination and used percentages to back this up; deleting the claim about discrimination but keeping the percentages is pointless. Remove the sentence entirely, and reinsert it if someone can find a valid source making the original connection between the relative ethnic homogeneity of Japan and discrimination.

 Yes, Humus, I think we should move on. Later in the AM, unless something at work commands my attention, I'll start yet another new section on the text itself. I will start from SlimVirgin's text and add a quotation from a Luther scholar that disagrees with him. I'll ask the same question I asked of Jayg... is there anything else you'd like to see in it? While I would like this section short for reasons you know already, I'm getting tired of having to repeat all of the arguments every few weeks. CTSWyneken  

 Several editors support the expansion of the summary of the sub-article Martin Luther and the Jews, beginning with SlimVirgin's suggestions. Humus_Sapiens has suggested we start over, get to the text, stop arguing over each others words. In that spirit, I have extracted SlimVirgin's version and added my own suggestions to it. Is this acceptable? If not, please list what should be added from your POV. It would help if we would all focus on the text itself, not engage in personal attacks or debate each other's point of view. We should limit ourselves to what we can quote or cite from scholars in peer reviewed sources. Especially for our members that are admins, is this fair? CTSWyneken

 :This review is transcluded from Talk:The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review. 

 Reviewer:   ·   

  

 I'm on much more familiar ground with this article than with the last of your GANs I tangled with. I wrote much of the two WP articles on Elizabeth David and her books, so you can set me down as another foodie. I blew the dust off Mrs David's Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and can tell you, if you'd prefer to add a page reference instead of the link at ref 17, that ED's mention of Lady Clark's Thick Parmesan Biscuits is on pp. 230–31 of my copy (the Grub Street 2000 reissue, ISBN 9781902304663). 
 Some comments: 
 *Lead 
 **""""Lady Charlotte Clark"""" – dear me, you'll upset those strange but harmless souls who sleep with Debrett under their pillows (I nearly wrote that they slept with Burke's): you mustn't call her Lady Charlotte unless she was the daughter of an earl or even posher nobleman. As her father was a commoner, she was Charlotte, Lady Clark. 
 **""""the cook Elizabeth David"""" – she was a cook, of course, but """"cookery writer"""" as you describe her later in the text seems a better description. 
 *Context 
 **""""You tell us practically nothing of the Clarks. There is a Times obituary of Sir John, dated 14 April 1910 (which I can send you if you haven't got online access to The Timess archives) which tells you more than enough for your present article. 
 **""""They lived for some years in Turin"""" – the last person named was Henry James, and I think you should write """"The Clarks lived…"""" here to avoid ambiguity. 
 **Blockquote – the parenthentic dashes should be either unspaced em-dashes or spaced en-dashes, and not hyphens. 
 *Book 
 **I don't for a moment suggest that you must do it, but have you considered putting the list of contents into two or possibly even three columns? Easier on your reader's eye, I find. 
 *Approach 
 **""""'Zucchetti à la Piedmontaise.'"""""""" – there is an extra set of closing quotes here 
 *Modern 
 **""""an inspiration for, the great Elizabeth David"""" – WP:OVERLINK at this point 
 **""""well-travelled diplomats wife"""" – I see you have faithfully transcribed the original, in which there is no possessive apostrophe. I'm not sure what to suggest here. It's too minor a matter for a [sic]; I think the MoS gives you licence to add the missing apostrophe silently. You may like to consider. 
 **In the first Holt blockquote, the quotation marks should be doubles, not singles. In the second there are more hyphens that need replacing with dashes 
 **Last blockquote – more quotation marks that should be doubles, not singles 
 *Notes 
 **""""Courgettes or Zucchini"""" – capitalisation really wanted here? 
 *References 
 **There are several mentions of """"Frere (1909)"""" but no bibliographical details of the work in the refs/citations section. They are included earlier, within the main text, but I think they should be repeated here with the refs. You should add OCLC numbers for both editions there, too: WorldCat will oblige. 
 **The links to the Find My Past site should include the {{subscription}} template 
 **You might standardise on either """"page"""" or """"p."""" in your book refs. Compare, e.g. refs 13 and 14. 
 **To my mind the bibliographical info for ref 14 should include the ISBN (or OCLC if for some reason there isn't an ISBN) 
 **Page ranges (ref 6) and date ranges (ref 14) should have an unspaced en-dash rather than a hyphen, and I should say the hyphen in ref 7 ought to be a spaced en-dash. 
 **Ref 15 – page number lacking (I can get this from the British Library after Christmas if it's a problem) 
 **Ref 16 – The Spectator should be italicised, as the TLS is in the previous ref. 
 Most of these are easy fixes, but I really would like the biography to be addressed, given that suitable sources are available. – '  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.380028247833252

 == Redirect of U.S. presidential election, 2012 == 

 Please see """"Election 2012"""" in .  Basically, the 2012 election was deleted after a VfD.  Unfortunately, this article would then get recreated by a user who wasn't aware of the VfD and didn't know why the community had decided that this wasn't a good article to create.  So, I figured that a good solution was to create a redirect that would let new users know immediately why the page wasn't to be recreated. 

 On the other hand, a redirect to U.S. presidential election, 2004 makes very little sense.  If you want to redirect to the last presidential election page, that would be 2008.  Either way is still highly confusing to your average user who will want to know why there isn't an article there, why they can't start one, and why the article is locked down.

 ==Down the memory hole== 
 Items deleted recently: 

 During this period, Perle is stated to have been investigated by the Justice Department, and found to have violated US policies relating to unlawful transmission of sensitive classified US information to Israel. """"An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy,"""" (They Dare To Speak Out, Chicago, Ill, Lawrence Hill Books 1989)."""" So far as can be determined, despite allegedly being caught spying for a foreign government, in the process undermining American national security, no action was taken against Perle at the time or later.  

  

 However, allegations of improper conflicts of interest, have nonetheless led to Perle's resignation from various positions. While serving on the Defense Policy Board, he was hired as an advisor for Global Crossing. It is stated """"Even as he advises the Pentagon on war matters, Richard N. Perle, chairman of the influential Defense Policy Board, has been retained by the telecommunications company Global Crossing to help overcome Defense Department resistance to its proposed sale to a foreign firm, Mr. Perle and lawyers involved in the case said today."""" Mr. Perle's fee is $750,000, but he will receive an additional $600,000 if the sale is approved.   

 Perle maintained that he had not violated any ethics rules, but decided to resign his position as chairman of the Defense Policy Board on March 26, 2003, . In an effort to save face, he wrote in his resignation letter that he would refuse any compensation with his deal with Global Crossing and """"any fee for past service would be donated to the families of American forces killed or injured in Iraq."""" There was also a report that """"The communications company, Global Crossing, also announced that Mr. Perle had decided to sever his ties with it.""""   

 As a former Clinton adviser observed with admiration, Perle “enjoys all the benefits of being an insider without any of the constraints.” 

 The Global Crossing affair started a more critical look into Perle's business affairs. On March 29, 2003, The New York Times reported that Perle was involved with Loral Space and Communications in 2001 as an advisor while it faced accusations that it transfered rocket technology to China.  It is worth noting that the Global Crossing affair was also due to Global Crossing trying to overcome Defense Department opposition to be sold to a venture with ties to China. In February 2004, Perle resigned entirely from the Defense Policy Board.  The full text of Perle's resignation letter may be found at the website for the public relations firm Benador Associates.     

 ===SEC singles out Perle for criticism===    

 On August 31, 2004, a special committee of the Board of Directors investigating the alleged misconduct of the controlling shareholders of Hollinger International submitted the 512-page Breeden Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the report, Perle is singled out as having breached his fiduciary responsibilities as a company director by authorizing several controversial transactions which diverted the company's net profit from the shareholders to the accounts of various executives. Perle received over $3 million in bonuses on top of his salary, bringing the total to $5.4 million, and the investigating committee called for him to return the money. Top Hollinger executives dismissed the report and have filed a defamation lawsuit against the head of the investigating committee, former SEC chairman Richard C. Breeden.    

 ''In a 513-page report shot through with sarcasm and disgust, a special committee of the publishing company Hollinger International Inc. concluded that the former officials Conrad M. Black and F. David Radler ran a """"corporate kleptocracy,"""" diverting to themselves virtually all the company's $400 million in earnings over seven years. The report, which was filed as part of Hollinger's effort to recover $1.25 billion from Lord Black and others, also criticized certain directors as being """"ine",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.273719310760498

 == 1999 Stanley Cup Final  Ignorance of Possesion Rules and Bias in wording == 

 In the 1999 season summary, I believe there is significant bias in the article. 

 Point by Point: 

 In the sixth game of the seven-game series, Brett Hull's triple-overtime goal - one that remains in dispute - How can something remain in dispute 5 and 1/2 years after it was decided conclusively by NHL officials still be """"in dispute"""" ?  If something was decided, it can no longer be in dispute.  

 as Hull's skate was visibly in the goal creaseended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. (In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal whilst an offensive player's skate was in the goal crease. - This statement ignores the puck possesion continuance rule, that was was even discussed by Gary Thorne and Bill Clement while there 'appeared' to be some question to the legality of the goal. The 1999 NHL rulebook also allowed for a person in posession of the puck to enter the goal crease. Hull's first shot was from outside of the crease, while shooting momentum carried his foot into the crease. The subsequent 2 rebounds came right back to Hull's stick. The goal was allowed to stand by officials on the ice, and contrary to popular thought, was reviewed by replay officials. Possession of the puck was what made the goal legal in the eyes of NHL officials. The puck meerly bounced off Hasek's left leg pad, and was only controlled on the stick by Hull's 3 shots. Possesion of the puck was therefore maintained by Hull, which would make the goal legal.  

 At the time, even Dallas Morning News hockey writer Keith Gave questioned the legality of the goal. 
 This may have been the case, but Keith Gave was notrious in Dallas for NOT being a pro-Stars beat writer.  His tenure at the Dallas Morning News was short lived, in comparison to writers at the Morning News since. 
 Regardless, the article fails to mention that those supporting the legality of the goal included Al Strachan of the Toronto Sun, Don Cherry of the CBC, and Wayne Gretzky - all of whom generally have broader appeal and understanding of the game than Keith Gave would.   

 This article has a general appearance of being either a) Pro-Buffalo Sabres  or  b) Anti-Dallas Stars  or c) Both

"In regards to a relationship, yes, Ryan is my younger brother.  He is not with the Jaguars, nor does he have a contract with them.  Only players with a signed contract can ever be considered roster players or members of the team/squad/franchise, where try-out players have no formal standing as a member of a team.  It is not uncommon for a free-agent player to 'try-out' or be 'worked-out' by multiple teams over a short period of time - none of which qualifies the player as a member of the franchise.  Perhaps for clarification analogies could be used: tryouts/workouts are equivalent to job interviews, pre-season would be equivalent to a three month internship, practice squad would be equivalent to a long-term paid apprenticeship (lasting up to two years), inactive roster players would be equivalent to full-time fully-licensed substitute teachers who are on the pay roll and have to report to work every day regardless if a staff-teacher (i.e. active roster player) is out or not.

"== Critique  == 

 Samuel Hopkins Adams was a very important muckraker to American History. Without the writing efforts of Mr. Adams, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 might have never existed. The Pure Food and Drug Act is a law that makes federal inspection of meat products mandatory and restricts the manufacture, sale, and/or transportation of contaminated food products and poisonous patent medicines. The Wikipedia article on Samuel Hopkins Adams is not as informative as the American National Biography. To begin the Wikipedia article is barely a page and a half while the American National Biography is approaching three pages. Both sources are credible but in the end the American National Biography gives the Samuel Hopkins Adams the respect he deserves and fully gives a summary of him, not just a jumbled and sparse summary of his life. 
 Unlike the American National Biography, the Wikipedia article just gives very basic information on Mr. Adams life while giving just a long list of all the literature works he ever wrote. The American National Biography gives a very good mixture of both and gives a better understanding to what kind of person Mr. Adams was and how his literature and his life connect. Mr. Adams date of death in the ANB article is November 16, 1958 while Wikipedia states the wrong date of death, November 15, 1958. The Wikipedia article is very random in the information it gives to its reader in a way it jumps all over the place and the ideas are not as organized as the American National Biography. For example, the Wikipedia article says that Mr. Adams was a “prolific writer” but fails to explain how but rather just runs off with all the works Mr. Adams has ever written which really is not helpful information into getting a better background of Mr. Adams. 
  Samuel V. Kennedy the author of the article for the American National Biography mentions Mr. Adams parent’s so we can see were he comes from as a child. His father was a minister so we can make the inference that Mr. Adams had some type of religious childhood. The Wikipedia article breezes over Mr. Adams education while the ANB mentions the college he attended which was Hamilton College and how even took a semester at Union College. ANB mentions that Mr. Adams was a devoted alumnus after graduation, he served as a trustee for Hamilton College from 1905-1916. Wikipedia also neglects to mention Mr. Adams awards such as winning an election to Phi Beta Kappa in 1907 and receiving an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1926, which is from the ANB article.  
 Both article mentions where his professional career began, which is the New York Sun.  Wikipedia fails to mention that Adams became an editorial staffer in 1904. A big fact Wikipedia does not have the ANB does have is that Adams worked with Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, and Ray Stannard Baker in which he specialized in medical reporting of public health issues which involved into muckraking. This is a very important fact because this is what Adams is known for muckraking and Wikipedia fails to mention this.  
 Wikipedia does go into depth about one book that ANB did not. Unforbidden Fruit was one of the more risky novels Adams wrote in the 1920s. Unforbidden Fruit and Flaming Youth were two books he wrote in the 1920s, that were about the sexual urges of young women and Adams published these book under the pseudonym Warner Fabian. Adams did this so his other works would not be looked at differently due to the sexual content of these two works. Another fact the Wikipedia article has that the ANB does not is that Adams was close friends with Ray Stannard Baker (investigative reporter) and Benjamin Darrow (District Attorney). Writing about history was not Adams strong point and when he wrote stories using the backdrop of history they were nowhere near as successful as his other works.  
 The Wikipedia article skips a segment of Adams life from 1905-1911. In the Wiki article there is nothing mentioned in this period while in the ANB we learned he was hired by Collier’s Weekly to write articles on patent medicines. This fact is important because this is what Adams is very well known for. We also find out Adams divorced his wife Elizabeth Ruffner Noyes in 1907, the Wikipedia article never mentions that he was married then divorced and then re-married again Jane Peyton who was an actress and had two daughters with Elizabeth Ruffner Noyes. Wikipedia also fails to mention that Adams didn’t just write books but produced 450 short stories and articles. ANB mentions how Adam’s papers are still being used by younger generations, which Wikipedia does not. This is important because the spread of his ideas and thoughts are still influencing generations way after his. His papers are used at Syracuse University, Hamilton College, and even Harvard University.

 == Is Ciliopathy  as a genetypic cause of phenotypical obesity  worth mentioning in the article? == 

 A few edits ago, I added a single sentence to the obesity article:  """"Obesity is one symptom reported in a newly discovered class of genetic diseases known as ciliopathies"""" which I sourced from this journal article:    My edit was removed, perhaps because I wrote poorly. 

 What I was trying to say is that there is now, as of some fairly recent developments in the genetics literature, at least a plausible hypothesis that one potential cause (underlying molecular cause, or underlying genetic cause) for some particular cases of clinically observed obesities is ciliopathy.  Perhaps my use of the word """"symptom"""" was a mistake; but I thought that saying """"one potential genotype for the obesity phenotype is ciliopathy"""" to be rather too esoteric.  Perhaps the entire sentence needs to be rewritten.  But I do think it is an appropriate addition to the Obesity article. 

 I am in no way saying that all ciliopathies result in obesity.  They obviously do not.  From the last ten years of work in molecular genetics with animals that have the cilia organelle, one thing that is obvious is that ciliopathies manifest in an extremely pleiotropic manner.  But there is a plausible hypothesis that has been put forward in the academic literature relating to a ciliopathic underlying cause for some clinically observed obesities; it has to do with a dysfunction in the molecular signaling pathway (along the cilia and/or basal bodies) that signals fullness, and/or taste, and/or time to move food onward in the large and/or small bowell, etc.  To date, most of the specific ciliopathic genes that have been related to obesity have been studied only in relation to more pleiotropic genetic syndromes such as Alstrom's, MKKS and BBS.  But the ciliopathic root cause, identified in some and implied in others, is encyclopedically interesting. 

 In my view, this newly-discovered connection is worthy of mention in the obesity article.  But I am not well-read on Obesity, so I will let those editors who frequent this article hash it out.  Cheers.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.006895542144775

 :Some deletions now have gone on, on that page. You did write there: Sorry, FT2, this block was not at all transparent. I did ask Charles to comment, but he is apparently off wiki for a time. I am not accepting your pro forma answer as to how he found this. I'd like him to say how he found out about this incident, because that may shed light on why this block happened. There simply isn't good evidence here to show outing, or a pattern of harassment. The evidence should be placed before the block, so as not to leave people guessing. Please don't wheel war over this, folks. Take it to WP:AN and discuss the matter to achieve consensus.  

 :I was offwiki at 1 am UK time, yes. Where is the issue of """"transparency"""" in WP:HARASS, by the way? The wording on """"attempted outing"""" is quite clear and unequivocal.

 ::I agree it's good to finally have this discussion. However, I would like to sound a note of caution here on concerns that seem related to WP:RECENT. An attempt was made to address this by making Tea Party Protests, 2009 time specific and WP:SPLITTING off the article because 1) there was a unique set of circumstances that formed and shaped events surrounding the Tea Party protests in 2009 and 2) there was a demand for an article that encapsulated the movement more broadly. Now, I understand the need for uniformity and proposing a shift from a date-specific article to a more general """"Tea Party protests"""" (without the year) article, but not at the expense of discarding completely relevant and well-sourced content. For example,  most recent proposal to begin removing or greatly reducing content from the Astroturfing section and the Responses section. First, there is no WP:DEADLINE. Second, before you start removing the Astroturf section, I'd like to you to demonstrate that the majority view is """"these are grassroot organizations"""" and the minority view """"that they are astroturfing."""" It's simply POV that """"In earlier months there were many sources suggesting astroturfing but in recent months I'm not sure I have seen a single suggestion that these are astroturf."""" The current article has at least two sources that suggest astroturfing in the last two months. My 2 cents.

 Links to WP:Formal organization and WP:Editing environment have been removed by Blackburne from the See...also section of Wikipedia shown below:  
 ::See also 
 :::*  An outline of English Wikipedia's administrative organization based upon Wikipedia articles about itself. 
 :::*  An outline of English Wikipedia's handling of editing disputes based upon Wikipedia articles about itself. 

 The in-line explanation for removal is that these links are """"inappropriate non-article links, per WP:SEEALSO. According to WP:SEEALSO:  """"Whether a link belongs in the """"See also"""" section is ultimately a matter of editorial judgment and common sense."""" On this basis, these links are appropriate here, as their purpose is to guide readers to the scattered WP documentation about its organization and procedures.  

 These articles are clearly labeled as guidance essays, which I suspect is the origin of Blackburne's reservations about them, as in his mind they are not """"articles"""" and so should never be linked in any article, whatever its nature. That is a very limited view, and assumes utility to readers has no importance.  

 Despite their labeling as """"guidance essays"""", these are not """"guidance"""" in the sense of being """"opinion"""" or """"interpretation"""" pieces. Instead, they are """"guidance"""" in the sense of leading readers to the appropriate WP statements and articles about WP organization and procedures. They are in the public domain, and any editor can add documentation on other aspects, or correct any inaccuracies. 

 As WP information is dispersed on many pages and is not terribly easy to find, this guidance is useful to the community. Some indication is that WP:Formal organization has about 100 hits a day while WP: Editing environment has about 15-20 hits a day. 

 With the obvious """"guidance essay"""" info box at the top, and the absence of advice or interpretation, no reader should confuse these essays with WP policies or guidelines.  Rather, these guidance essays are obviously aids to finding WP documentation about how things are organized and how they work. They provide useful See...also links for readers of Wikipedia.

"Personal view: I agree that Asuka is a proud, strong individual. Her goal is to succeed. As the story goes she graduated from college/university at an early age and was excited to join the EVA project. She has tried to mature very fast, although at the age of 14 this is surely a huge strain. Her brave efforts to succeed are constantly grounded by Shinji, who unwittingly has a 'natural talent' for piloting EVA 01. However hard Asuka tries, Shinji always seems to be better then her. Eventually this drives Asuka into making a foolish attack on the fifteenth Angel Arael which in turn mentally rapes her, leaving Asuka almost comatosed.  
 Prior to this Asuka is a strong, sociable, likeable character and as with many characters in the story, you find your self sadenned by the terrible events that unfold around such promising ability.

 The number 30 was used by myself for very good reasons.  You yourself have stated that 29 matrix schemes are still operational - a figure drawn I believe from the matrixwatch.org website.  As my own matrix scheme - www.cyberama.net - is operational but classified as non-operational by matrixwatch.org (why I do not know!), then 30 must be the minimum number of matrix schemes operational currently.  As stated before, this is a conservative number - I personally believe that there are far more but this would be unverifiable without some intense work verifying all known matrix scheme domains.   

 To include the number of matrix sites that have ceased trading would be hard if not impossible - there is no proof that any domains that would be claimed by anyone were ever matrix schemes.  If domains have expired, there is no evidence that either they ever existed or what their content consisted of.  Therefore, I feel it is unverifiable to state any given number of matrix schemes that may have ceased trading.  Stating that many have ceased trading is the best solution, in my opinion.   

 In my mind, the term """"operational"""" regarding a website would mean that it was viewable and that it is possible for it to operate.  Therefore, any matrix scheme that is able to take payment should be regarded as being operational.  www.dictionary.com defines the term as, """"Fit for proper functioning; ready for use"""".  I would have to say that as both Arzel personally and matrixwatch.org have stated that they 'know' 29 matrix schemes are operational, it is silly for them now to backstep and try and say that there is no way to 'know' these sites are operational.   

 Would it be of additional help in the History section to include details on Gotmatrix?  This was also a very well-known matrix scheme that is apparently still operational and trading - and is one of the older websites too.  Greg, the owner, is still answering emails - when he chooses!

"== Your editing on Wikipedia == 

 Chris Siloma, welcome to Wikipedia.  I wanted to post this message to bring to your attention a few concerns about your editing on Wikipedia: 

 #It appears you have a conflict of interest with most, if not all of the subjects you are writing about.  Wikipedia has some clear guidelines about editors who edit in subjects they have a conflict of interest with.  See WP:Conflict of interest.  It is usually a very good idea to not edit articles that you have a conflict of interest in, especially if you will have difficulty being neutral or fair about the subject.  For example, if you have an interest in promoting a band, you will not be able to write about them in a fair or balanced manner. 
 #You have regularly opposed deletion of your articles on the basis that people would be interested in knowing about the subject.  Unfortunately, human interest is not a basis for a subject to have a Wikipedia article.  To have a Wikipedia article, the subject must meet our policy on WP:Notability. There are more specific guidelines for bands (WP:BAND), alubums (WP:NALBUMS), songs (WP:NSONG), persons (WP:BIO), and companies (WP:COMPANY).  I strongly urge you to read these policies and guidelines before creating another article. 
 #You cannot copy and paste material from one website to Wikipedia, even if you are the owner of the copyrighted materials.  See WP:COPYPASTE.  Wikiipedia does not accept unlicensed, copyrighted materials.  If you want to license your work for use on Wikipedia, see WP:Donating copyrighted material.  However, please note that this will mean anyone can use your work with attribution, not just Wikipedia - and can profit of your work without paying you.

Half of wikipedia is all false and the real stuff gets deleted all the time!!!!!!!!!!! 
 They just want to promote the buddism and blow it out of proportion and say its linked with a Hindu God. Absolutely incorrect, he was a King (they say he was a jutt/jatt also)and he left his Kingdom at the time King Asoka was repenting for all the deaths of the war so Buddha stated his religion of non violence.  
 Many people leave their riches to become priests and saints its quite common. 

  Now when did Vishnu awtar """"Krishna"""" say don't kill at all, he never said don't kill he said kill all your relatives to Arjun, if you read the Bagavadgita then you will undestand the concept entirely. Even the Awtar Parshuram killed all the kshatriyas then why did he kill them himself. When Vishnu came as Narsimha he killed Hiranyakashyap too. 
 When Vishnu awtar came as Matsa awtar then why did all of the people drown and only the so called """"Noah"""" (of western thought) and his ark survived? Where did the rest of the people go they died or were killed too isn't it. 
 Bhuddist philosophy is totally different than Hindus it doesn't match at all. They have even their own different deities with different names.

 """"The message America's Army sends itself is propagandistic. It propagandises a certain kind of lifestyle message in which the army would like the participant to join and become. Propaganda itself has a history within religion. Religion also sends the same message, to let the participant (or the participant in becoming) join and become the religion (so sending the message of religion). So America's Army, with its governmental background, is instead of an advergame, better to be described as a propagame.""""

 """" From the analysis of the advergame and the striking resemblance I have described with the propagame America's Army I will now turn my attention to the consequences for communication on Internet by such games."""" 

 """" The exception is America's Army because it communicates itself as a company in which citizens can join. The aim is to let the gamers themselves join the company as an employee and be the producers within of the message the army sends. One of the aims of advergames is to construct a process of viral marketing, but this is done unlike the propagame. The advergame aims that consumers virally communicate about the game or the message it beholds for the purpose of spreading the word, but not to become one with the company itself. DaimlerChrysler for example wouldn't make a game in which one is being trained to become the director of a car factory (this would create competition). Not yet (emphasised), but maybe in the future it will when one seeks for employees."""" 

 """"I thus called it a propagame: a game that propagandises a message to become the message. Within the game, gamers are disciplined and the power structures are like the common army power structure: top down hierarchical.""""

"""=Terminology=== 

 The term specific intensity is used in the classic works on radiation such as Planck 1914, and many other authoritative physics texts. That was the reason for introducing this article; that reason has nothing to do with computer graphics. The classic authorities actually speak of specific intensity without the qualifier radiative because they are writing in a radiative context. 

 As for seniority, one could ask 'seniority of what?' Seniority of Wikipedia entry or seniority of material? Does the Wikipedia have a policy of authority for seniority of Wikipedia entry? The term specific intensity is over a century old. The term radiance is an update """"improvement"""" promulgated by authority of committees and is the product of committees. 

 Paltridge and PlattPaltridge, G.W., Platt, C.M.R. (1976). Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology, Elsevier, Amsterdam, page 35, a reliable source in its field. comment: """"Even basic quantities such as radiant flux and radiant intensity as used in the general literature are not often the same as the formally endorsed definitions of those terms."""" 

 So far as I understand it, the function of the Wikipedia is to collect and report and make accessible findings from reliable sources, which are many and various in this case. So far as I understand it, it is not to act as a thought-police to enforce exclusive conformity the recommendations of committees, which are only one kind of reliable source, and not to try to regulate diversity of viewpoint, and not to try to enforce conformity to the one and only true and correct and errorless and completely general doctrine and point of view and form of language. 

 According to Born and Wolf Born, M. (1999). Principles of Optics, seventh edition, reprinted 2003, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 194, a reliable source in its field. and to HapkeHapke, B. (1993). Theory of Reflectance and Emittance Spectroscopy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 64, also a reliable source in its field., the terms (spectral) brightness and specific intensity and spectral radiance mean the same thing. They refer to a field quantity per unit frequency or wavelength, per unit area, per unit solid angles. They refer to a fileld of non-collimated light. They are different from irradiance and from (light) intensity, which both have the dimension of energy flux density per unit area. Intensity refers to a beam of collimated light. Irradiance refers to non-collimated light immediately originating from a specified surface per unit area of view from a specified direction. 

 The reason for the qualifier specific is to make the term apply to uncollimated non-blackbody radiation as well as to blackbody radiation, and to provide for solid angle. 

 The term (light) intensity by itself is sometimes (Born and Wolf 1999) used to refer to the intensity of a collimated beam. This is also called the irradiance. 

 The specific intensity of a thermal radiative field is non-zero because it is per unit solid angle, while the (integral) flux in any exactly specified direction is infinitesimal and unmeasurable as such. The intensity of a collimated beam is not infinitesimal and is measurable as such, because it is in the exactly specified direction of the beam. 

 Born and Wolf comment: """"It is unfortunate that the same word is used to denote two different quantities."""" 

 The term brightness is currently defined in its Wikipedia article with the source given as the ordinary language dictionary of Webster. A different definition is given in the Oxford English dictionary but is not cited by the Wikipedia article. No opinion is offered by that Wikipedia article as to the relative reliabilities of those two sources. The Wikipedia article on brightness currently does not have much to say about brightness referring to specific radiative intensity, apart from offering opinions about what is """"correct"""" according to the US government. In the latter opinion, it seems from the Wikipedia article that brightness is currently opined as a term of psychophysics, not of the physics of matter. Perhaps someone will feel like remedying this. 

 As for specificity for light, the terms discussed in the present articles in general refer to all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, not just to the visible wavelengths. Some authors regard the term light as referring to all wavelengths, not only to the visible.

I read couple of books about the Soviet propaganda and books covers during the Winter War, and patriotism was note a first subject in those.

 == Request to reconsider deletion of the Hemobag == 

 Hi, W. Marsh, 

 You deleted The Hemobag but I have permission from the company to create the wikipedia entry (let me know what proof of permission that you need).  

 Although the Hemobag is a commercial product, it is legitimately one of about 3 ways to process and transfuse a patient's own autologous blood during surgery. Moreover, the article is loaded with valuable background information on blood salvaging and educational references on """"bloodless surgery"""" and bloodless surgey websites and also takes a neutral point of view on the product. 

 I note that wikipedia has other entires on blood salvage companies, most notably [Haemonetics]: 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonetics 
 They have a company entry with none of the educational material that I used in the Hemobag entry. Seems weird to me! 

 Please reconsider deletion of the Hemobag or let me know what I can do to make it acdceptable. Many thanks.

 *** 

 Before Genesis 

 It all began a few billion years ago when one of God's high-ranking creatures, Satan (Iblees, Iblis, Lucifer, Shaitan, Shaytan), developed a supercilious idea that he could run a dominion as an independent god besides God. This challenge to God's absolute authority was not only blasphemous, it was also erroneous. Satan was ignorant of the fact that God alone possesses the ability to be a god, and that there is much more to godhood than he realized. It was the ego - arrogance augmented by ignorance - that led Satan to believe that he could take care of a dominion, as a god, and run it without disease, misery, war, accidents, and chaos. The vast majority of God's creatures disagreed with Satan. Yet, the minute egoistic minority that agreed with him in various extents were in the billions. Thus, a profound dispute erupted within the Heavenly Community (38:69) [I had no knowledge previously, about the feud in the High Society.]. The rebels' unjustifiable challenge to God's absolute authority was met and resolved in the most efficient manner. After giving the rebels sufficient chances to denounce their crime and submit to Him, God decided to exile the hard core rebels on a space ship called Earth, and give them yet another chance to redeem themselves. 

 If you claim that you can fly a plane, the best way to test your claim is to give you a plane and ask you to fly it. This is precisely what God decided to do in response to Satan's claim that he could be a god; God appointed him a temporary god on the tiny speck Earth (2:30, 36:60). [Recall that your Lord said to the angels, """"I am placing a representative on Earth."""" They said, """"Will You place therein one who will spread evil therein and shed blood, while we sing Your praises, glorify You, and uphold Your absolute authority?"""" He said, """"I know what you do not know."""" & Did I not covenant with you, O Children of Adam, that you shall not worship the devil? That he is your most ardent enemy?] As for those who agreed with Satan, they were given a chance to kill their egos and submit to God's absolute authority. While the vast majority of the guilty creatures took advantage of this opportunity, a miniscule minority of creatures failed to take advantage of this offer (33:72). [We have offered the responsibility (freedom of choice) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, and were afraid of it. But the human being accepted it; he was transgressing, ignorant.] 

 The dispute in the Heavenly Community led to the classification of  God's creatures into different categories: 

 (1) The Angels 

 Creatures who never questioned God's absolute authority were classified as angels; they knew that God alone possesses the ability and qualifications to be a god. The vast majority of God's creatures - countless numbers - belong in this category. The number of angels is so enormous, even the angels do not know how many of them there are; only God knows their number (74:31). [None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is a reminder for the people.] 

 (2) The Animals 

 Although the angels suggested that the rebels and their leader should be exiled from God's kingdom (2:30) [Recall that your Lord said to the angels, """"I am placing a representative on Earth."""" They said, """"Will You place therein one who will spread evil therein and shed blood, while we sing Your praises, glorify You, and uphold Your absolute authority?"""" He said, """"I know what you do not know.""""], the Most Merciful willed to give the rebels a chance to denounce their crime, repent, and submit to His absolute authority (33:72). [We have offered the responsibility (freedom of choice) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, and were afraid of it. But the human being accepted it; he was transgressing, ignorant.] The vast majority of the rebels took advantage of God's gracious offer to re-enter His kingdom.

I would say that it instead was a mutation by natural selection that appeared suddenly in wolves, and is now growing more common through wolves that have that gene mating with other wolves who have the same gene and the pups ending up with two of the black pelt genes, therefore making them black-pelted instead of the usual grey, red, or white pelts.

 OK Crvena Zvezda is a club in Serbia but have roots from there brothers Turkey! 

 OK Crvena Zvezda  is a team volleyball club from Belgrade, Serbia.

 Cleo se kleo 
 This summer one player from Brasil was tricked to come to FK Secanja, they told him about Bari and Tokyo, but they forgot to tell him that, that was 19 years ago.He signed the contract, and when he came to Belgrade he saw what he's done.FK Secanja was broke,they didn't have food, the poor guy was starving.But then he realised that bigger club was on the other side-FK Partizan Belgrade.He's gonna sign a contract with them and now he has food and money.FK Secanja fans became pissed off and got back to being depressed again.Now Partizan fans sing to gypsis """"Cleo se kleo da me je voleo, a Cleo se kleo da me je voleeeeeeeoooooooo"""" 

  

  
 Dule Vujosevic 008 
 If it's something that KK Sledeca Sezona hate it's a mr. dr. Dule Vujosevic!Gypsis are so powerless because that guy won 8 titles with Partizan in a row!In 2002 it was 15:8 for KK Sledeca Sezona in league titles, after Dule came in 2001, 8 years later it's 16:15 for PARTIZAN!That's why they're pissed off at mr. dr. Dule!After 8 titles in a row Partizan fans joke about it, they say """"Dule Vujosevic needs to marry KK Sledeca Sezona...He's f****ng them for 8 years now"""".To soften gypsis pain when Dule is f****ng them, Grobari made Dulex, a new condom to easy the pain of neighborhood girl! 

  
 Gypsis 
 They cry, whine, it's always the referee fault, they smell, they have complex of Grobari(Real Serbians), Gypsis are albanians half and half Croats,The founder of FK Secanja was Krcun, murderer of Serbs.That's why gypsis in last eternal derby they had Torcida flag on """"Sever"""".

 Hi - just saw you undid my edits in that section, and read the reasons mentioned: 
 """"related  
 """"NPOV"""" 
 """"fringe conspiracy theory"""" 

 - It is a section on criticism, and criticism is rarely """"NEUTRAL"""" (if neutral exists at all - it is at best """"widespread opinion"""") 
 - The criticism mentioned is a not only a very important but also fairly unpopular one because of its direct implications, hence the label """"conspiracy theory"""" that is a very convenient way of ignoring them. 
 - The economists researching this topic are few, and tend to agree (hence, the """"consolidate related criticisms"""". 
 - Don't you think NOT mentioning this sort of criticism is actually more dangerous than letting it be so that people can attempt to refute it? 

 Personally, I came upon this research and it dealt a blow to my views of the banking system, and I haven't found solid refutation so far. 
 I think it is important to bring more awareness to verify this, rather than hide it, which is why I added it to the """"criticism"""" section. 

 How do you think?""",0,0,0,0,0,0,6.860003471374512

 Admittedly, this may be unconvincing to you, but, to cite Wiktionary: 
 vagina (plural vaginas or vaginae or vaginæ) 
 # (anatomy) The passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus in female mammals. 
 # (zoology) A similar part in some invertebrates. 
 # (botany) A sheath-like structure, such as the leaf of a grass that surrounds a stem. 
 # (colloquial) The vulva. 

 So, no, it's not """"wrong"""". It's just colloquial (non-technical) usage. Besides, the issue is usage, not definition; OED won't always have usage information, and is more a source for definitions than usage. Also, it's not just me that uses it this way; using vagina to mean vulva is widely used, at least in my experience. I imagine you've heard plenty of people use it that way, and even used it yourself. Most importantly, in most conversations, if someone says vagina, most people would understand that to mean vulva, not the technical meaning of vagina listed in the article. When usage is so widespread, no matter one's opinion of it, it can hardly be called """"wrong"""".   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.338317394256592

 I question the statement, """"The narrower and more technical meaning of aerostat refers only to tethered or moored balloons: here, airships are distinct from aerostats."""" This distinction is less technical rather than more technical, since it arises from a misunderstanding of stat meaning stationary, i.e. moored. It actually refers to the lift for the craft being aerostatic, as opposed to aerodynamic.

 == History of Orbital Definition == 
 While presenting at the 1979 Sanibel Symposium, I had the occasion to ask Per-Olov Löwdin for his definition of an orbital. Without hesitation, he told me that it was first used by Robert S. Mulliken """"in 1925 as the English translation of Schroedinger's use of the German word, 'Eigenfunktion'."""" Mulliken had been working in Germany in 1925 with many of the founders of Quantum Mechanics and particularly in 1927 with Friedrich Hund on the beginnings of molecular orbital theory. Mulliken presented his work at that time in Physical Review. Löwdin told me to look there for the first use of a hydrogen """"orbital"""" in English. He also agreed that a suitable definition of an orbital would be """"a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of an electron"""". 
 I will edit the definition to reflect this usage of the term as a mathematical function, but also connect it to the more general description of an orbital as a """"region of space"""" that can be calculated from the function. 
 The advent of graphing calculators has enabled even high school students to grasp the definition of an orbital as a mathematical function. I invite educators to have their students graph the """"simplified' 1s orbital, y = exp(-abs(Z.x)), where Z=1,2,3(Atomic Number). This simple exercise can display the effects of electronegativity and the fact that atoms and isoelectronic ions """"decrease"""" their size in going to the right in a row in the periodic chart. 
 The bonding and antibonding sigma MO can also be displayed by y = exp(-abs(Zx+1) + or - exp(-abs(Zx-1) . After graphing functions, students can grasp the idea of """"combining"""" functions (atomic orbitals) to get other functions (molecular orbitals), and what is meant by the + and - signs or the red/blue, white/gray colors of the orbitals.

"""== About Bhagat Singh == 

 Bhagat Singh - 27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931)[2] was an Indian nationalist considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. He is often referred to as Shaheed Bhagat Singh, the word Shaheed meaning """"martyr"""" in a number of Indian languages.[4][5][6] Born into a Sandhu Jat Sikh family which had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj, as a teenager Singh studied European revolutionary movements and was attracted to anarchist and marxist ideologies. He became involved in numerous revolutionary organizations, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) to become one of its main leaders, eventually changing its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928.[7][8][9] 
 Seeking revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai at the hands of the police, Singh was involved in the assassination of British police officer John Saunders. He eluded efforts by the police to capture him. Together with Batukeshwar Dutt, he undertook a successful effort to throw two bombs and leaflets inside the Central Legislative Assembly while shouting slogans of Inquilab Zindabad. Subsequently they volunteered to surrender and be arrested. Held on this charge, he gained widespread national support when he underwent a 116 day fast in jail, demanding equal rights for British and Indian political prisoners.[10] During this time, sufficient evidence was brought against him for a conviction in the Saunders case, after trial by a Special Tribunal and appeal at the Privy Council in England. He was convicted and subsequently hanged for his participation in the murder, aged 23. His legacy prompted youth in India to begin fighting for Indian independence and he continues to be a youth idol in modern India, as well as the inspiration for several films. He is commemorated with a large bronze statue in the Parliament of India, as well as a range of other memorials.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,6.989986419677734

 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) (Hindi: भारतीय विशिष्ट पहचान प्राधिकरण), is an agency of the Government of India responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card or Unique Identification card (UID Card) project in India. It was established in February 2009, and will own and operate the Unique Identification Number database. The authority will aim at providing a unique number to all Indians, but not smart cards. The authority would provide a database of residents containing very simple data in biometrics. 
 The agency is headed by a chairman, who holds a cabinet rank. The UIDAI is part of the Planning Commission of India. Mr. Nandan Nilekani, a former co-chairman of Infosys Technologies, was appointed as the first Chairman of the authority in June 2009.Mr. Ram Sewak Sharma, an IAS Officer of Jharkhand Government cadre has been appointed as the Director General and Mission Director of the Authority. He is known for his best effort in e-Governance project for Jharkhand State and working as an IT secretary he received a number of awards for best Information Technology Trends State in India. 

 Launch 

 UIDAI launched AADHAAR program in the tribal village, Tembhli, in Shahada, Nandurbar, Maharashtra on 29th September, 2010. The program was inaugurated by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh along with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The first resident to receive an AADHAAR was Rajana Sonawane of Tembhli village.

This comment was from his """"Dennis Miller Live from Washington D.C."""" set, which was released in 1994.  Here is the full quote: 

 ::“Now I know (Stockdale’s name has) become a buzzword in this culture for doddering old man, but let’s look at the record, folks. The guy was the first guy in and the last guy out of Vietnam, a war that many Americans, including our present President, did not want to dirty their hands with. 

 ::The reason he had to turn his hearing aid on at that debate is because those f***ing animals knocked his eardrums out when he wouldn’t spill his guts. He teaches philosophy at Stanford University, he’s a brilliant, sensitive, courageous man. And yet he committed the one unpardonable sin in our culture: he was bad on television. 

 ::Miller went on to jest that the job can't be that hard, considering that Dan Quayle had done it for the previous 4 years.   

 ::To be clear, this was an unusual move for Miller at the time, but he frequently talks about the effect that the 1992 election had on him.  Dennis Miller has repeatedly stated that the evisceration of Stockdale in 1992 was the first thing that started nudging him to conservative views, and September 11th was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Any user can start the bot, but the message (/Spam) must have been last edited by someone who's on the access list.

 Hi, i dropped NY, MO, another state wikiproject banners that u had just added to Talk:Washington Bridge (disambiguation).

There is no need to add state banners corresponding to every item in every disambiguation page!  I wouldn't even add CT to this one, myself.

Mostly based off the NRIS database covering approx 85,000 places, of which maybe 5,000 are non-unique names (like Smith House or U.S. Post Office).  This was a major project to create all the disambiguation, and it is worth maintaining by wikiProject NRHP.

When I clicked the link in the Articles and Members section of our Biomembranes wiki page, I was surprised to know that I was assigned to edit a different page.

Whereas the page I'm proposing to edit is more focused on lipid signaling, with a section on second messenger lipidsthe same topic I presented in class.

 ==Comments and Editing== 
 Overall, the Lasioglossum malachurum entry is well organized and provides insightful information about this species. The writing is condensed and very accessible ensuring that the complex behaviors discussed can be understood by a wide audience. I am especially impressed by the “Colony Cycle” section which included a comprehensive and detailed time scale about colony formation. When editing this paper there were a few places in which there needed to be additions of linked words to enhance the reader's understanding. In the """"Dominance hierarchies"""" section, I included a link for the word gynes. Without a link or even an explanation for gynes there was gap in the readers understanding of the dominance hierarchies as the future queen caste plays a distinctive role within a nest. Within the """"Mating behaviors"""" section, I linked lek mating. This is an important concept that needed to be linked because it is very difficult to understand and connect the other facts included without having a basic understanding of lek mating. Because I thought this concept for so essential I also added sentence giving the basic definition provided by the paper Hotshots, Hotspots, and Female Preference in the Organization of Lek Mating Systems by Bruce M. Beehler and Mercedes S. Foster. Within the """"Aggression"""" section, I linked the word antagonistic behavior because having a linked page could be helpful for readers who are having trouble understanding this section. Lastly I made an organizational change by deleting part of the information included in the “Taxonomy and Phylogeny” section and including it within the “Distribution and Habitat” section. I made this change because the information was regarding behavior differences due to varying environments and I believed that information would make more sense within another section.    
 :Thank you for your contributions to the L. malachurum page! I think your changes to the organization and clarifying sentences were very helpful.

 == """"Shoot the Moon"""" == 

 In the liner\program notes of my local cable provider, in the """"Wyatt Earp"""" movie, the character(and therefore alluding to the actual historical person,) was said to be a """"Southern boy"""". However, the actual history is plainly seen that Wyatt and his family hail from the north (Illinois, later California, with Wyatt rambling about in Missouri, and Kansas). His brief troubles in Arkansas would harldly qualify him as a """"son-of-the-south"""", to say the least. The tag on the liner notes suggests that arguably the greatest """"cowboy"""" who never was can be claimed by """"Southern Revauchists"""" 

 Nothing is obviously further from the truth. Although most Hollywood films(and vintage dime-store novels) have been out right lies about Earp and his exploits and personal dealings, the Kevin Costner film ironically comes closer to the truth. Added to the fact the the ENTIRE EARP CLAN were fierce Lincolnite Republicans, fought for the Northern Union, and despised the southern, pro-slavery Democratic Party, of which the Earps' nemeses the Clantons, Mcclareys, and the cowboy\russler gangs belonged. 

 What's ironical in this is that the elongated bio-pic of Earp, gives a more accurate account of the wherefores and whyfors of Wyatt's personality and motivations(unlike the current trend of deconstructionism in most modern biographies in film and print). The curious """"public"""" reaction of disfavor in the iconic western hero presented as yet another pragmatic and woefully flawed H-U-M-A-N, is more likely limited to the cracker-minded mentality of those who would rather live and die by fantasy over historical veracity. Also the boiling-up of old hatreds between """"Yankees"""" and """"Rebels"""". (Of course it must be said that Hollywood had-as yet-an unexplained growing hatred towards Costner at about this time.) Wyatt can't be claimed by 'southern' romantics, not now, and of course, never. 

 The misleading liners on the cable program must be changed.

In fact, they were just a series of newspaper articles that kept repeating the same story over and over again, about Tristan Loraine and the film he produced.

The trouble is that the article is structured in such a way that criticisms such as Bardi's don't really fit in anywhere. He isn't evaluating 'the device', he is evaluating Rossi's claims regarding it. And since everything we know about the device (beyond the obvious, that it is a device which seems to take cold water in at one end, and emit hot water and/or steam at the other) is solely sourced to Rossi, Rossi is now flatly contradicting things he said earlier, and is still refusing to let anyone do any meaningful independent evaluation at all, one has to ask whether we should be implying in our article that it is the device that is now the centre of attention, rather than Rossi. Perhaps the section entitled 'Evaluation of the device' should be retitled 'Evaluation of claims regarding the device' - and expanded.

 Kevin is walking down the street and notices some sluty dressed girls and says-""""Hey there...ladies"""" 

 -A homeless guy, ofcourse generic homeless guy, brown clothes, dirty, grey mustache, older, bumps into Kevin- 

 Kevin-""""Do you have any idea who I am, I am the only person in the world to rate a 10 on a scale of ass-kickery""""

 -The homeless guy mumbles and walks off- 

 -Kevin looks at the poster and realizes he is no longer the highest ranked on the scale and breaks down- 

 -Changes scene to Sarah back in the studio behind the desk where Kevin usually is- 

 Sarah-""""This will all soon be mine Muhahahaha"""" 

 -Kevin bursts on studio and grabs a shovel out of his robe and hits Sarah's head off, which is obviously a manican. 

 Kevin-""""Over my dead body."""" 
 - 
 This is a pretty good script, and it will be funny after its done cause clearly Sarah isnt dead cause she is still on the show, so the script holds no meaning

 Another would be have the homeless guy instead of being generic homeless guy, have him look like the homeless guy off of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, I know Kevin knows what im talking about here 

 And last, have Sarah say """"This will all soon be mine Muhahahaha"""" in a bored normal voice like she was reading it or something, and have her actually say Muahahaha, instead of laughing

 Here's some things that need doing! 

 # Visit the talk page of the Membership List and join Esperanza! The main page is locked until voting is complete, but adding your name to the list there makes you a member! 
 # Put Wikipedia:Esperanza/December 2005 elections/Vote on your Watchlist (visit the page, then click """"watch"""" on the row of buttons at the top-middle of your screen. That way you'll see the most recent changes to the page. 
 # When you see a change, it's probably someone voting. Check the person making a vote is listed on this page. If they're not, edit the page, cut the vote out and re-post it on this page instead. Then write to the person and very nicely tell them what you've done and why (ie they're not a member). Be careful - the membership list is in plain-text, whilst the votes are signatures: peoples' account names and signature names sometimes don't match! 
 # If all is well with the vote, check the tally on the right side of the page and see if it matches the number of votes. If it doesn't, edit this page and bring the tally up to date. This page uses wikitables - as you're new, these may be a bit daunting, so feel free not to do this! 
 # If you spot a change has been made to the voting page and it looks like vandalism (someone removing votes, blanking the page, adding nonsense etc), revert the vandalism by going into the edit history, choosing the last good edit, clicking the date of that edit, """"edit this page"""" and save it. That goes back to the previous version. Put something like """"rvv"""" (re-vert-vandalism) or """"rv blanking"""" (re-vert blanking) as your edit summary. 
 # Voting is """"approval voting"""". No-one may vote """"against"""" or """"neutral"""". All votes must be signed and dated: you may have to pick through the edit history if you find one that isn't, then write to that person and ask them to sign their vote with ~~~~ for the avoidance of doubt. 
 # Always assume good faith on behalf of voters and candidates. Errors are likely to be simple mistakes that anyone could make.

 == Errors by Willis et al. and by User:Boundarylayer == 

 Boundarylayer, first lets review some discussion etiquette. You should NOT be using SHOUT-OUT BOLD TEXT TO EMPHASIZE YOUR PROMOTIONAL VIEWPOINTS, UNLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU TO DO THE SAME, under the 'what's good for the goose is good for the gander' dictum.   If you don't retract your shout-out bold text, we can all turn this discussion page into a zoo spectacle of crazy fonts.  Would you like to further this discussion in !Patchwork font, or can we resume improving the article in a normal type style? 

 Several of your edits have been skewed with POVism, bias and factual errors.  For example in one of your earlier discussions above you pushed the US annual mortality of 440,000 birds as provided by the USFWS, without mentioning, as stated in this very article, that the """"... USFWS later [pointed] out that it was only an 'estimate' by one of many scientists and was not officially supported by the agency"""". Then about a week ago you inserted a mortality rate for wind energy of 2.94 deaths per GWh into the table of US bird mortality, using a bogus combined total figure for both bird AND bat mortality taken from Willis. 

 You further shouted out several errors culled from Willis et al., referring to the Willis's article as being """"peer-reviewed"""", although it is clearly designated as a """"Forum"""" article immediately above its title, with an acceptance date only seven days after it was received.  A forum article that sorted, adjusted and compiled data from hundreds of studies being peer-reviewed in seven days?  Really??  You then ignored the """"Megawatts are not megawatt-hours...."""" rebuttal article by Sovacool, also bearing a Forum designation, which immediately followed the Willis paper as pointed out by KDP earlier, above this new section. 

 What Willis et al. did, or didn't do is equally relevant. They accurately pointed out that chiropterans are not birds and that Sovacool should not have implied his meta-study results for birds should also apply to bats. They further pointed to instances of Sovacool using 'gray' studies and the lack of detailed data related to bats. Then they proceed to essential make the same or similar errors in consistency in methodology and accuracy that Sovacool was accused of, such as completely confusing nameplate megawatt capacity with megawatt-hour electricity production actually created. Willis et al. thus undermined their own assumptions of deaths per MWh.  Sovacool pointed to instances in his rebuttal of Willis et al. where the Willis group: 
 #  failed to adjust death rates downwards, where required, in addition to upwards, thus conflating total mortality due to wind energy; 
 #  used 'gray' studies, even after criticizing Sovacool for doing just that; 
 #  criticized Sovacool for the supposed underestimating of scavenging losses and the overestimating of searcher efficiency, then offering significantly higher death rates based on different data sets that Sovacool did not use, all the while ignoring and failing to apply the same adjustments to nuclear and fossil-fuel electricity studies, making those power sources appear more benign in comparison to wind energy; 
 # criticized Sovacool for not including habitat loss due to wind farms, ignoring the far smaller footprint created by wind farms compared to the significant habitat loss created by uranium and coal mines; 
 # criticized Sovacool for lack of detailed mortality rates across species and time periods, while they employed studies using the same summary methodology used by Sovacool; 
 # pointed to 'disproportionate [negative] influence' of some wind farms, without applying the same standard to nuclear waste lagoons and artificial coal flyash 'ponds' (such as the one that collapsed in Europe two years ago devastating a wide area). 

 Although you have done your best to denigrate Sovacool's meta-study, it did what his 2010 Forum rebuttal article claimed:  It provided """"....a rough sense for what wind, coal, and nuclear sources may be doing to birds, bats, and other animals"""", something that the non-renewable energy industries would much rather the public remain ignorant on. In the same rebuttal article, Sovacool also pointed to the Sundqvist and Soderhom papers which showed the environmental and social costs of nuclear energy as 29 times greater than those of wind energy.   That appears nowhere in your edits to this article or on this article improvement page.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.202991485595703
"Yes, Andrei, your comment (irredentism) is disappointing to me. Yes, I'm a Dalmatian of Dalmatian ancestry (islander) and I'm proud of it. My natural language is Chakavian Croatian, it means that I usually speak a lot of Dalmatian (Romance) language words, but also there are many words of Venetian origin (transferred to Chakavian during Reinnesance). What's more, Chakavian was the original language of the first Croats who initially appeared in the northern Dalmatia, the oldest Croatian inscriptions were written in Chakavian Cro and Glagolithic alphabet. Additionally, the Croats were the saviours of the Latin culture in Dalmatia, they never tried to destroy it, they completely excepted it and practically prolonged its life, so you can say that Antique has died by natural death in Dalmatia and not by force, while in many other parts of Europe it disappeared by violence. On the other side I'll always fight any kind of nationalism, including Croatian and Italian, but it's not the case here. Is it? I'm actually a supporter of Chakavian revival to the modern standardized Croatian (based on Neo-Stokavian), so it would include Dalmatian Romance words too!  
 :I don't support any theory to prove something. I've just reported about modern tendencies in historiography concerning the most of Europe and here I was talking about all Illyricum and not only about Dalmatia or Croatia (and I've specified Dalmatia as one of the most Romanized regions of Illyricum in this discussion above there). BTW multidisciplinary science has described Croatian ethnogenesis in the main elements like this: Liburni, Iapodes, western Ardiaei, Dalmatae (which includes a few other familiar tribes), Histri, OstroGoths, Sclaveni, Romans (Dalmatian languages speakers in the coastal Dalmatian cities in the Early Medieval).

 I agree that this might be too detailed (and technically worded) for this article. However, that was the only place relative volatility was mentioned, which seems like a relevant associated topic.

"== PERSONAL ATTACK  == 

 I was actually going to adress your points one by one but as you have made a personal attack on me by implying i support the one drop rule i wont even bother. I never once said i supported the one drop rule i was simply refuting your suggestion the reason non hispanic white Americans have African ancestry is because of an official policy of hyperdescent(as you falsey implied) but because blacks circumvented the one drop rule and passed for white, i used the term black and passed in the context of American history and not an expression of my own point of view. 

  
 If i belived in the one drop i would not have said - most of the descendants of black slaves in the U.S are white, i would have said - most of the descendants of black slaves in the U.S are black, which i did not say. 

  
 I actually new you were going to insult me somewhere down the line because your arguments make no sense and when people make arguments they know deep down are false they normally resort to personal attacks, all of the arugments you use to underplay or deny hyperdescent/whiteining could be used to underplay or deny the one drop rule but you only try and underplay and deny hyperdescent/whitening, i wonder why that is? 

  
 The fact you have resorted to a personal slur on me by implying that i belive in the one drop rule when i have said no such thing and not address many of my points i have made demonstrates you have no counter argument and the fact you ignored whitening further illustrates this. 

  
 Genetic admixture graphs based on Bertoni et al, Admixture in Hispanics: Distribution of Ancestral Population Contributions in the United States, Human Biology - Volume 75, Number 1, February 2003, pp. 1-11 Concude hisapanics in the U.S are between 34%- 67% yet most Hispanics in the U.S self ID as white. 

  
 Lets just say for arugments sake the most white Hispanics in that study self ID as white (51%-68% European), unless your going to argue that Europeans arrived in Latin America 51%-68% European you would have to accept that Hisapnics are defining themselves by hyperdescent and this is the only reason to explain the disparity between non hispanic white Americans who are 90% + European and non hispnics white Americans who are much less European (51%-67% European). If not due to hyperdescent/whitening - how else do you explain U.S white hispanics haveing the most lowest European ancestry of any self defined white group? 

  
 The Law of - Gracias al Sacar was not the - Limpieza de sangre, the term castizo predates the 18th Century The Gracias al Sacar was a law which came into being in much of latin America in the 18th Century and it allowed acknowledged mulattoes and mestizos to become white, you really need to learn history is about the facts SamEV not what you distort and call fact. The way in which you constantly imply that hyperdescdent is practiced in equal measure in the U.S and Latin America is another distortion of history, its almost as if your trying to grant hyperdescent legitimacy by falsey implying hyperdescent was as widespread in the U.S as it was and still is in Latin America which is not true. 

  
 Quotations from the anthropologist Peter Wade, viceroy of new granada, Dr. Carlos Moore, Edward E Telles and Clare Ribando Seelke a specialist in Latin American Affairs confirm that some blacks class themselves as mulattoes and that some mulattoes class themslves as white, you think this is of no importance on a page where the primary subject is mulattoes? 

  
 You free to deny or underplay hyperdescent, your free to tell yourself the lie that-  people arrived from Europe to Latin America 68% or lower European depsite the fact no European country has such a low level of European ancestry. The truth is White Hisapainics have much lower levels of European ancestry (in the case of U.S Hispanics 68% or lower) because they are defining themselves by hyperdescent and are accepting mixed race people as white and this is why they have such low levels of European ancestry, the classification of mixed race people as white (hyperdescent) is an intergral part of mullato history and is linked to the low levels of white ancestry many white Hispanics have.  

  
 The total abscence of hyperdescent which meant many mulattoes passed as white and the law Gracias al Sacar an which aloud mulattoes to become leagly white, in a page which primary subject is mulattoes presents a false and biased version of history because it leaves one with the false imppression all mulattoes were classed as mullaotes when many were classed as white and this is linked to the fact that most of todays white Latin Americas are of mixed race descent.

 The Scout Association of Hong Kong is the overall Scouting organization in Hong Kong. After the first Scouting initiatives in 1909, the Hong Kong branch of The Boy Scout Association of the United Kingdom started in 1914 by registering the St. Joseph's College Scout Group, and was formally established in July 1915. The Hong Kong branch became an autonomous association and the 111th member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1977. In 2008, the association had 99,591 uniformed members, with approximately 2700 Scout groups in the sections Grasshopper, Cubs, Scouts, Venture and Rover Scouts, making it the largest uniformed youth organisation in Hong Kong. The headquarters at the Hong Kong Scout Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, host the administration, headed by the Hong Kong Chief Commissioner. The association runs campsites, including Gilwell Campsite, Tai Tam Scout Centre and Tung Tsz Scout Centre, as well as hostels and Scout Activity Centres. It annually organises the traditional Scout Rally, providing Scout competitions and activities. For specific anniversaries, themed Scout Jamborees have been organised. (more...)

 :The extensive publication information fills up too much crap on the main article. The plot should go with the lists of chapters (they have a parameter for it in the template). I'm keeping reception, production, and censorship on the main article. I've put Ghost in the Shell exactly where I think it should be at this stage.—Ryulong (琉竜)  
 ::Yeah, but those parameters are better suited for summary, not extensive plot and longer on-goiing series such as Naruto or Bleach. The original should at least be covered in detail in the main article. Publication History is key aspect of the manga. Example: Ghost in the Shell 1.5 chapters originally ran in Young Magazine as """"Ghost in the Shell 2"""" but were delayed to be released so they can be released later as """"Ghost in the Shell 1.5"""" simply adding their first release dates doesn't really help (especially Ghost in the shell 2 that has three versions). And again, idk who, but someone made a bad set up with """"Publication History"""" as someone added the unrelated box set of posters and 3D papercraft book. So the reason why it looks huge and unreadable is the fact that it has an additional fourth paragraph completely unrelated to the publication history of the manga. Remember, its a list and a child article, so that info still has to reflect in the main article. And unlike episode lists, this list-article isn't made due to size issues.   
 :::I'm treating it as an episode list so the main article doesn't get bogged down with the details of every single scene. The other books don't need to be mentioned in much detail, you're right, but we do not need to give all that level of detail on the main article when just the publication dates of the original manga are needed.—Ryulong (琉竜)  
 ::::But you can't treat this like an episode list, a normal episode list would be 6 to 8 times longer. Publication history is long for a reason. And its a bit exagerrated to say every single scene (although I agree with 1.5, but gits2 and gits1 were properly summarized). If you read the manga, the first and the last three chapters played were relevant to the main plot. The rest were side stories. Mentioning the three versions of GITS2 is simple too. """"Extended version"""" ran in Young Magazine, """"Short cut"""" version released in limited edition box, and """"standard"""" (the last one) is well...the standard edition.  
 ::::Plot and publication history are relevant to the main article. Yes, its a lot of info, but not enough to merit a list article. Chris is going to use that to split the manga info. If production and reception (yes I know, censorship, but again, not that significant.) I think a few extra info can be added to Publication (not a lot) and bring full story of the original manga (the main plot).   
 :::::But the main article doesn't need all of the publication history. Look at Sailor Moon#Manga. That's all the information on publication they have with a longer section at the list of chapters. I've expanded the plot summary on the main article, but I don't know enough about the MANMACHINE INTERFACE or HUMAN-ERROR PROCESSER books to write anything more detailed than the two senteces as they are now. I will not agree to Chris's form of the two page system because it just does not make sense and is not featured in any other anime article.—Ryulong (琉竜)  

 Well probably not republications such as Kodansha USA, but noting the alternate versions is important for at least gits2. And probably noting what makes each one different isn't that important either. 

 Git2 all takes place in the same day and each chapter at a different time (2:00pm, 4:00pm etc.). Oddly, the prologue and epilogue are before all the other chapters and explain where motoko's evolution has reached. So Gits2 main plot could be first and last chapter. Gits1.5 is about section 9 without Motoko and the new tongue and cheek humorous section 9 member Azuma and a little bit on Proto. However Gits1.5 has no specific plot.

"Yeah that would be an option, but I would call it 'other measures' rather than roof height, because a roof height is never provided on CTBUH. The issue I am raising is it's very often that we can't decide where the roof is. Take the example you gave, Q1. Where is the roof? Is it at the roof of the topmost inhabitable floor? (just over 200m) Is it at the top of the plant room? (a few above that) Or is it at the top of the decorative glass blades that wrap around the top of the building but in no way constitute a structure? (more like 245m) This is why, if you look at CTBUH for Q1, as with just about every building, they don't include a roof height (http://skyscrapercenter.com/building/q1-tower/399). The roof heights are impossible to find. An observatory figure is given for Q1 (235m) which is the height of the floor of the observation deck. No roof height given. Same goes for any other building. They will sometimes give height of highest habitable floor (not the roof, whatever that is), sometimes observatory if there is an ob deck, but they will not even attempt to give a 'roof' height because CTBUH will not even try to define where the 'roof' is. This is why the roof heights for our table are all off sources like Skyscrapercity forums, because CTBUH doesn't actually provide them. As such I'd say we should include a column for other measures and for each building we can include whatever measures we like, so long as a reliable source is found.",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.387759208679199

I have also expanded the section on Prank Calls, which is where the references to Mr. Deutsch should be in.

These prank calls were inspired by the Tube Bar prank calls, a series of prank calls placed in the mid-1970s. The two callers, John Elmo and Jim Davidson, made similar calls to the owner of the Tube Bar. After Deutsch realized that the call was a joke, he would spew out a series of profanity-laced threats. The recordings of these calls were widely circulated in the 1980s and 90s. is enough about the guy to give somebody a taste, and if they are interested, there are now 3 links to follow - Louis """"Red"""" Deutsch, Tube Bar, and Tube Bar prank calls.

So, Wikipedia would be better off following in-depth reportage and scholarship rather than some list-style, offhand report produced by civil servants (not so much offense intended)namely, for example, the 2004 book by scholar Janet Bennion, who lived among the LeBaronites in the course of her gathering information on the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times (which is still almost entirely the predominant LeBaron sect), Bennion was led to believe by Colonia LeBaron residents who are fundamentalist Mormons that they continued to self-identify as belonging to the Church of the Firstborn of the Fullness of Times and the six references to the full name of the sect in her book were not accompanied by any qualifications. (E.g., see book's initial Col. LeBaron chapter where it says,""""The socialpolitical structure of Lebaron is based on the rules and structures extablished in the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times...."""" From the newspaper and magazine articles about this community I have read, it IS a very liberal one, comparatively speaking. However, even if the Chihuahua LeBaronites have experienced some diffusion of authority, resulting in a kind of independent-style Mormon fundamentalism somewhat typical of, say, the Centennial Park community (a situation which I merely speculate about since no sources would indicate this to be the case), the controlling fact here on Wikipedia is not Truth but verifiability, thus we are stuck with Bennion et al's statements that the community DOES indeed self-identify as holding to the beliefs and culture of the Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times.

 ==This article is unfit to appear in an encyclopedia== 
 The bias is in the title. The title puts one side in a debate on the real topic (the amount and nature of racism in the country in question) on the back foot before the first word of text, and the neutrality of the article cannot be recovered after that catastrophic start. This article sets out to group together a group of slurs under the pretence that together they make an encyclopedic topic. This is no more the case than for """"Allegations that French people smell"""". Or imagine other series of article built around usage of slurs in the media: Allegations that Tony Blair is a liar, Allegations that Angela Merkel is a liar, Allegations that Bill Clinton is a liar, or Allegations that Paris Hilton is a talentless bimbo, Allegations that Lindsay Lohan is a talentless bimbo, Allegations that .... is a talentless bimbo. All of those could be sourced, and the fact that something is sourced does not necessarily make it neutral or a legitimate subject for an encyclopedia.

 == Science fiction elements  a nitpick == 

 Science fiction is a genre of fiction dealing with imaginary but more or less plausible (or at least non-supernatural) content such as future settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, aliens, and paranormal abilities. Exploring the consequences of scientific innovations is one purpose of science fiction, making it a """"literature of ideas"""". Science fiction is largely based on writing rationally about alternative possible worlds or futures.[2] It is similar to, but differs from, fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Wikipedia, article on Science fiction. 

 It therefore seems to me that the heading 'Science fiction elements"""" is erroneous, and at least some, and probably all, of the matters considered under that heading should be under a 'Fantasy Elements' heading instead. I see nothing in the 1001 Nights that is derived from 'scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws'.    Eric""",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.296034336090088

"""Shakespeare again== 
 :::Dear Nectar, I think you are misrepresenting Tom Shakespeare. The first of those two external links that you provided is written by someone other than Shakespeare and it only summarises his view in one (rather crude) sentence. The second external link doesn't say anything in support of your interpretation. However, if you read his book you will find that he unequivocally states: 
 ::::“The Human Genome Project has been hailed as the Holy Grail of future health. I would argue that it does not mark a radical departure from traditional approaches to the ‘disability problem’. While historical genetics operates at the level of populations, contemporary eugenics operates at the level of the individual and families. While the rhetoric speaks of improving health, the current reality is that detection and termination are the only option in most cases” (1995: 8-10). 
 :::Thus, Shakespeare recognises that new genomics """"does not mark a radical departure"""" from old eugenics.  
 :I am sorry. I never saw Shakespeare's article toward the bottom of that first link . But still, I think Shakespeare may have been misrepresented. In the paper that Nectar kindly brought to my attention, Shakespeare states """"I do not think that we live in a society with eugenic policies, and i do not think that the reproductive decisions of men and women are eugenic. However, I do not htink that the problem ends there"""". He then goes on to discuss the """"illusion of choice"""" that is offered 'to men and women' in their reproductive decisions. For instance, he says that 'the conveyor belt of routine testing and anti-natal care removes the possiblity of informed consent, and drives people toward decisions that they may not have wanted to make'.

 All I see is brief mentions and one-sentence quotes from individuals associated with the organization, but not """"significant coverage"""" of the organization itself.  Sugarcube73 on his user talk page has thrown up a list of other sources, most of which fail WP:RS as blogs, chat forum posts, etc. or they're self-published PR, etc.  The article itself suffers from COI editing, lack of sourcing, WP:SPIP, and WP:SELFPUB #5 (the article should not be based primarily on selfpub).  The usual remedy is to edit the article and use the significant coverage in reliable sources, but they don't exist.  My attempts to find better sourcing on Google News and Google Scholar turned up next to nothing.  What's your take on this?  Should the article go to AFD?  Can you find any better sourcing?

"""(outdent) Of course, Kevinalewis. The quick answer is probably all the sections...! As examples, here's a start: 
 #Introduction: """"The book primarily deals with the transformation, through youth's vigor, of a moribund and slothful community."""" Is that really how we would describe the action if we hadn't had a lipogram before? Does anyone seriously write like that in an encylopedia? Take a step back and formulate the book's themes without looking at the article, then see how they compare. I think you'll find the word choices stilted. 
 #Plot sections: How is the """"Plot introduction"""" section different from """"Plot summary""""? How many sections of the current article mention Wright's introduction? The """"Lipogrammatic quality"""" section certainly does. We could consolidate them into a section that lays out Wright's aims with the book. Also, the article suffers from some lengthy quotes that don't seem to be making a point—""""Plot summary"""" contains one without any context. What is that quotation from Gadsby'''s first paragraph supposed to add? I left it in during my cleanup runs a while back, mainly because I didn't know what it was there for. 
 #Characters: Mostly a list. How many of these are important to the plot? We don't need to be exhaustive and list everyone in a Dickens novel; why should we do so in a less important work like Gadsby? Trim the cruft and expand on the main characters. Further, why is the radio station listed in the Characters section? Such organization is what makes me think it would be better to start afresh with some or all of these sections. There are only so many repairs you make to an old car before buying a new one. 
 #Lipogrammatic quality: Logically, this section ought to be more important than Characters. At the least, it should be moved higher. It could be fruitfully combined in a section about Wright's purpose. The phrase """"inability to use numbers from six to thirty"""" is clearly related to Wright's phrasing (""""The numerals also cause plenty of trouble, for none between six and thirty are available.""""). As such, let's either quote him directly or make it more clear—for example, """"Wright could not use numbers between seven and twenty-nine because they all contain the letter E""""). The riffs on famous sayings should probably mention what the original saying is. (How many readers will know Keats's """"Endymion""""?) 
 #Criticism and acclaim: The first paragraph reads like a list of reviews selected for their lipograms rather than their content. I really doubt that every reviewer, or even a majority, chose to copy Wright's style. Are any of these reviews adding to our knowledge about Gadsby'', or are they simply showing people like to copy Wright's wordplay? The second paragraph is a mish-mash of works that nod to Wright; there's useful stuff here, but the prose has no guiding thread. -

If you do that, and can show some decent sources, I'll help you work on it and make sure it's in reasonable state before moving it to main space. LadyofShalott  

 I have found a similar company page to the one I wish to create at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASOS.com This page also appears to contain advertising type content however. It is part of two projects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Business and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Companies both of which would be appropriate for AIM listed Solid State PLC. The main source I've found thus far is the London Stock Exchange itself at http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary.html?fourWayKey=GB0008237132GBGBXAIMI, the Solid State PLC website at http://www.solidstateplc.com/ and various other financial news sources such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance and a whole host of financial PR sites.

 == League runner up claim == 

 There's an error in the article. I didn't remove it because it has a reference and I didn't want to risk upsetting the ref number system. (Not sure how it works.) 

 It concerns the 1980-81 season. It says if Ipswich had won their """"last"""" game, they'd have been champions. This is not the case. The match in question was their second-last as they had a game in hand on Villa. Had they won it, they'd have still been in second place and would have needed to win the final game too, to catch Villa. So it never came to a """"win and we're champions"""" situation, as stated. 

 The inaccurate reference given is for a You Tube vid (!! reliable sources!). 

 If anyone doubts this by the way, check out the final league table, which shows Ipswich finishing 4 points off the top. So a win in the match in question wouldn't have been enough.

  Sincerely, thank you for your responses here AGK; they have been quite insightful. And yes, I did chew your arse out, but not because  you think I am thinking you are """"defending homophobia""""; but because you came to my talk page and threatened me with an indef block over a comment which you weren't sure what attacking Fae; yet those editors who you know were acting in a homophobic way towards Fae, I can see no such warning towards those editors. So for some reason I wasn't afforded the same courtesies as others. Anyway, as we said moving on, I've accepted your apology, and we continue to discuss this. 

 On your talk page I also took you to task for what I, and many others, see as inappropriate interactions on wikipediaforum.com. You acknowledge two things in your reply, that I would like to continue to discuss here initially. 

 You mention that it's probably best that you stay away from sites operated by and which have participation in by people such as Eric Barbour. I couldn't agree more. Roles of editors who are Arbcom members are responsible to the community; not to people as Eric Barbour, who is not a member of the community, and not without good reason; and certainly not to Wikipediareview or Wikipediaforum. You stated that Wikipediaforum.com is more of a serious attempt at a WR. I disagree. For example, in that thread that you participated in, Eric states clearly that there is a """"private"""" Wiki in which details on numerous editors are being collated; likely for use in future. This is not very transparent of them. 

 The second point is the most important point. Critique sites, in some opinions, may serve a purpose. But they should not be given information when detailed information on a case is not provided onwiki. Such as this case. Additionally, onwiki is the place to critique anything to do with the community, such as what I have done in the past, and am doing right now, because to do otherwise is playing into agendas that others may have with this community. 

 You noted above that you voted to ban Delicious Carbuncle. I can only see one place on WP where any such vote took place, and that was at Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive737#Block_request  note, that from that section to the very bottom of the page deals with Delicious Carbuncle; first where he tried to have me blocked for bringing in  the much supported view that he was harassing Fae  compare this to DC's summary that was supported by only a single person! Having gone thru this entire discussion I can't see your comments, nor vote, there. So this leads me to assume that discussion occurred on the Arbcom mailing list; because again, I can see no discussion anywhere onwiki by the Committee. 

 Just yesterday, I saw that the WMF has passed a resolution on transparency; it got me thinking, perhaps our community, and especially the Arbitration Committee, should have requirements for transparency on this project. But it already does have such procedures in place as per Wikipedia:AC/P#Committee_resolutions, which require that resolutions and their results be posted to the Arbcom noticeboard. In this instance, it has not occurred, and because there is no privacy concerns in relation to this case (banning of Delicious Carbuncle), so it is in itself a breach of the internal policies and procedures of the Committee; and even moreso when Fae was never notified of the outcome of discussions and votes. 

 In the interest of transparency, and keeping inline with these policies and procedures, I requesting that the Committee published as required, the resolution/s as it/they was/were discussed and was voted on, to the Arbcom noticeboard, and also in the interest of transparency for the following Arbcom members indicate whether they supported the banning of Delicious Carbuncle from the community for what many community members felt was harassment of Fae.

 ==Visit to Greece== 

 I found this very intriguing article in a magazine called Odyssey and the feature is written by Jonathan Wingate. 

 The photos show Ringo Starrr and Paul Mccartney in Greece in 1967 who visted Greece several times, watching locals folk dances at Itea, a seaside village on the coast below  
 Delphi. According the press reports, the trip in July 1967 included a cruise of the Northern Sporades and a visity to Arahova, a mountain village near Delphi, where a short rest on a rooftop terrace turned into an impromptu celebration. 

 Paul quotes: """" In the song 'Girl' that John wrote, there's a Zorba-like thing at the end that I wrote which came from that holiday. I was impressed with another culture's approach because it was slightly different from what we did. We jsut did it on acoustic guitars instead of bouzoukis."""" 

 """"Ringo and I, particularly, used to be able to get off to Greece, because it was far enough away for nobody to know who we were.

 ==Coinage== 
 Does anyone know when this phrase was coined?   

 ===I know this=== 
 The term is related to the improvements made to automobiles.  Those improvements made driving an automobile simpler and easier.  The automatic transmission is the most important of them. Driving an automobile became simpler when the manual foot-operated clutch was eliminated.  The term appeared around 1955 to 1960.   

 By the way, let me say this: in the 1940s few women drove automobiles.  Some automobiles required the use of a hand crank to start the engine.  Only strong men could start a car that used a hand crank.  Today, electric starters allow anyone to start an automobile. 

 I had wished to answer the question at the top of this page in 2006, but I kept on putting it off.  

 Early automobiles required the driver to manually control ignition timing and operate a hand fuel pump, changing gear often required the use of pre-selectors or """"double de-clutching"""" techniques.  The elimination of the clutch with auto boxes has never been universally adopted so can't be the """"most important"""". Besides it hasn't benn """"eliminated""""; I've never owned a car with automatic transmission.   

 ==The connection to American slavery==   
 This page is one of the best pages in the Wikipedia.  I located it less than an hour ago.   

 The practice of keeping Negroes in a mentally inferior position was a practice which ensured that peaceful slaves would form the bulk of their group.   

 At times, the leader of a group of slaves would be killed to remove the most capable person from the group.  Wiki Apalachee reveals that Spanish missionaries were slain in order to weaken a group of Indians.  Dumbing down of slaves is an old practice.  It has resurged in the United States since 1950.  The appearance of new laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 produced hostility amidst the more numerous white people.  Negroes have undergone a dumbing down in the USA since 1950.  There are fewer educated Negroes today, particularly doctors (including dentists) and nurses.  Modern people claim that Negroes are too dumb to be dentists, despite the fact that Negro doctors and nurses were commonly-seen components of the United States before 1970.   

 Even very simple tasks such as driving a truck are now viewed as being things that Negroes are too dumb to accomplish.  Slaves had cooked food for their masters, but modern Negroes are regarded as being too dumb to learn how to prepare food.  The dumbing down of Negroes is an industry in the USA.        

 :Under the older way of life called """"racial segregation'"""" colored people in the United States were forced to produce their own doctors, dentists, nurses, restaurateurs, nightclub owners, taxi-cab company owners, and other people because that was their only way to receive various common services. (Taxi-cab companies would not ride Negroes).  After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, """"racial integration"""" appeared.  Under the new """"racial integration"""" way of life, it is theoretically possible for a colored physician to treat white patients in a medical facility.  The way to keep that scenario from becoming a reality is to keep the colored people too dumb to become skilled medical practitioners.  Ergo, dumbing down is rampant, pernicious, and ubiquitous, now.  There used to be a need for colored doctors, dentists, nurses, etc., but """"racial integration"""" has replaced them with people of other racial types.    
 ::That made no sense as it had no context.-''''''   ''''   ''''''  

 What a bizarre pair of posts, a series of racist generalizations with absolutely no supporting evidence, using obsolete terms (""""Negroes"""", """"coloreds""""), all in support of the idea that civil rights gains have led to the """"dumbing down"""" of a race. And these gems of quotes: 

 Under the new """"racial integration"""" way of life, it is theoretically possible for a colored physician to treat white patients in a medical facility.

 """"The only difference is that those born in the Republic who are Irish Citizen by birth, achieve this citizenship automatically; those from Northern Ireland need to specifically declare themselves to be Irish Citizens in order to be so, unless they have parents or grandparents who are already Irish Citizens. Those from Northern Ireland have the exact entitlement to Irish Citizenship as those born in any other part of Ireland."""" 

 This was true under the pre-1999 laws, however now the key question as to whether one is a 'full' Irish citizen at birth or just 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen is based not on whether one is born in the ROI or Northern Ireland, but on whether one has another citizenship at birth.    

 Most people born in Northern Ireland do have another citizenship (British) but the law applies equally to those born in the Republic of Ireland who acquire British or another citizenship (by descent) at the time of birth.    It's a grey area if the 'other' citizenship requires registration, in the case of Australia, for example. 

 All that said, the distinction between someone who is 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen and an Irish citizen proper is a grey area.    It is unlikely that it will be tested in the Irish courts, however it may become an issue in a foreign court (if entitlement to citizenship of another country depends on not having Irish citizenship).    One one construction, the distiction is merely a political statement that certain Irish citizens will not be treated as having that citizenship unless they wish to.

 Hi Jrae15vb. My name is Backslash Forwardslash. I am a Wikipedia administrator, and I noticed you have recently created a userpage. I don't intend to scare you away or attempt to intimidate you, but I thought you might want to reconsider some of the items on your userpage. You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release personal information about yourself (real name or age etc), which could be used against you in the future. While 99% of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly, welcoming and harmless, there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so 'high-minded'. A handful of editors have even felt real-world implications due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information.  

 Protecting your privacy, and remaining anonymous while on the internet — on any site — is a good idea. The internet is a worldwide and largely unregulated medium, and while Wikipedia is one of the safer sites, there are definite risks while online. With cyber-bullying and cyberstalking becoming increasingly commonplace, it is important that you take every precaution to remain safe. 

 I have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being, just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display. As a result, the information is only available to administrators. You are, of course, welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them, but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum. If you wish to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it, I can request oversight on your behalf. You are also welcome to discuss this with me on , or privately via e-mail if you have any concerns. Again, I do not want to scare you.

 The Eastern Committee of the War Cabinet considered that British India had been drained of troops and decided to avoid committing more troops to Persia from Europe, by sending a mission of picked men to train local recruits at Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the capital of Georgia. The War Office undertook to send  officers and  to organise local forces and replace the Russian Caucasus Army. Another force was to be raised in north-western Persia by by Lieutenant-General W. R. Marshall, commander of the III (Indian) Corps of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force (MEF Lieutenant-General Frederick Stanley Maude); the French took responsibility for the area north of Caucasus. In Armenia, the local Christians had been sympathetic to the Russians and feared that a revival of Ottoman power would lead to another massacre. It was believed in London that they would be willing recruits and that some Russian soldiers in the region remained willing to fight, despite the Russian Revolution. 

 On 13 April 1918, the Baku Soviet Commune, a Bolshevik and Left Socialist Revolutionary (SR) faction led by Stepan Shahumyan, was established in Baku, having overthrown the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. On 26 July, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship, an anti-Soviet alliance of Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks), overthrew the Baku Commune in a bloodless coup. All the factions involved tried to gain support from about  and Austro-Hungarian former prisoners of war. Those men willing to fight tended to be sympathetic to the Bolsheviks based in Astrakhan and at Tashkent, the terminus of the Trans-Caspian railway (Central Asian Railway). German and Ottoman armies in eastern Ukraine and Caucasus sent troops and diplomatic missions to Baku and further afield.

 Relatitivy fundamentally is about how perceptions of the same events are changed by virtue of being in different frames of reference.

 I will be highly oblideged for telling me about this Nairutya hint in any Sanskrit scripture if one has ever came across.

"== World Champions == 

 Hey Jersy: 
 Whats up? Thanks for your kind words about my articles on my talk page. Im very flattered every time someone says something good about my articles. It says a lot about each of us responsible wikipedians as well, because I have learned from you and everyone else a lot of things about life and about writing just by reading wikipedia articles.  

 Well, about the world champion boxers, its just that I was an amateur boxer myself when I was 12-14. I didnt make it, and let me assure you for everyone that wins a world title, there are , well not 1,500, but I can tell you none of the twenty five guys that trained at my gym ,and these included two world ranked boxers, became a world champion, thats why I feel that the status world champion is a special one so thus should be put next to the boxer's name, just like Presidents are not merely mentioned as politicians next to their names.  

 I'd guess the ratio is about 500/1 to 800/1 as far as the kids who fight as amateurs and those who go on to become professional world champions.  

 BUT, I'd hate a revert war and furthermore, I'd hate to have you an enemy, as a mater of a fact I mean to become friends with everyone here if possible. So Im not gonna put world champion again unless for some reason I forget.  

 Thanks for everything and God bless you!

":To Homefill: 

 What is the “good faith” sense of posting “unconscious in an airplane bathroom with a needle stuck into his arm” Homefill?  What relevance does this offer to an encyclopedia entry?   

 Kennedy doesn’t hide his past struggles; he talks about them openly in books and interviews.  Did it occur to you to post that he has been sober ever since, over 20 years now?  
 I’m not trying to remove the heroin possession fact, so there’s no “whitewashing” going on here.  Explain for us, what is your purpose then, to include sensational, potentially libelous, and unverified claims of unconscious lavatory floor needle-in-arm allegations. 

 Time magazine reported in 1983: “Traveling alone from Minneapolis to Rapid City, S. Dak., aboard a Republic Airlines Convair, Kennedy suddenly grew sick and dazed. Alarmed passengers near him reportedly summoned the flight attendant, who passed the word to the cockpit. The pilot radioed ahead to Rapid City to request that a paramedic and ambulance be on hand to meet the flight. When the plane landed, Kennedy was helped down the steps, but declined medical assistance.” 

 That was reported soon after the incident in 1983 (and is consistent with other news accounts directly concerned with the bust). Now contrast that with the revisionist sensationalism in the Times UK in January 2007 in an article about politics, (not a secondary source in a contemporary report about this specific incident). 

 Look closelyhttp://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1294908.ece at the way the Times correspondent botches the details of the incident: “after he was found unconscious on the floor of a South Dakota airport toilet with a needle stuck in his arm.” 

 Can you find any contemporary account of this incident that claims that Kennedy was “unconscious” or “on the floor” or in an “airport toilet” (he was on the plane, remember? Not in the airport).   

 Your source is clearly not accurate. Do you concur that this Times UK story is not the best reference to rely on here? 

 Why did you remove my citation to the contemporary New York Times coverage then? 

 I suspect others will agree with me that there’s no “good faith” in your efforts here. Is it your intent to use this graphic imagery to slander the man?  If not, then stop riposting this fictitious claim, please.  

  
 Regarding the NRDC, no, they are not a “lobbying firm” in fact.  They hold 501(c)(3) status with the IRS as a non-profit organization. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)  As such, they are quite restricted in the amount of lobbying they can do and it’s not their primary function (which is public education on environmental issues, followed by occasional litigation to ensure enforcement of existing environmental laws).  

 In fact, this encyclopedia's creator holds the same designation, please look at the bottom of this page where it says “Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., a US-registered 501(c)(3) tax-deductible nonprofit charity.”  Would you call Wikimedia a “lobbying firm” Homefill? 

 As a 501c3, NRDC is nothing like the groups you list: AARP (a 501c4, donations are not tax-deductible), MPAA (a 501c6 trade association, donations are not tax-deductible), or the Moral Majority (which dissolved in 1989). 

 Agreed?  So then, how about this: 
 “a non-profit organization based in New York which works to strengthen existing environmental laws.” 

 That description is based on facts “easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person,” not on agenda-driven, disparaging mischaracterizations like yours. Remember: “make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,6.4409990310668945

 ::You accused me of very serious POV and deleted all my edits which now you say only had a few issues about 'wording'. That is a very serious allegation to make, without discussing it first on any talk page and you did NOT (for those interested see the article Cham Albanians and the history section of the page). You stated yourself in the Cham Albanians article that most of the edits were 'ok'. I resorted to those measures in haste (after you deleted everything and called it POV !) as i was not aware of the procedures. As for you """"are out of serious arguments"""", i think i made my point since you state in the same sentence """"the existence of a tiny community is ok to be mentioned"""". Then you should only have deleted part of what was written, not the whole thing, and discussed the rest of the talk pages. As an editor you don't delete if you think something should be there, but needs more work. Your editing skills are questionable after these actions. Even words in your reply have issues about maybe what sentiments you have towards Albanians. For example Albanian Muslims were not """"hosted"""", even though they were Greece's citizens. Citizens are not """"hosted"""". Tourists, refuges, migrants and so on are """"hosted"""". The living conditions of the Albanian community are important to be mentioned.

 ==Page Structure== 

 Ok looking at the possibility of expanding this page, I think there's structural things which may need to happen: 

 ===International Focus=== 

 Most sections describing naturopathy, and even many of the criticisms, are based on north american naturopathic practice. As education, practice, and regulation can vary quite considerably from country to country, I'm recommending that at the very least the """"Practitioners"""" section, which could include education and professional bodies, be laid out in a similar manner to the regulation section. As for methods, there are some things I know Naturopaths in Australia either can't do legally, such as Acupuncture or Chinese medicine, which are now both regulated, or aren't generally trained to do. I think the only greatly controversial thing in BHsc(Nat) is iridology, which just takes up one unit. The other thing I've noticed on some pages is the """"reception"""" listed by country, and I'm also wondering where private health rebates fit in. Is that a regulation issue? 

 ===Criticisms and Controversies=== 

 I think this could well be made into a section on its own, the criticisms particular to north american naturopathic practice already have enough to fill one subheading, as does cancer, vaccines, safety of treatments, the claims of lack of scientific basis, the issues surrounding unlicensed or unqualified practitioners (a big one in Australia). I don't think much of this belongs in other sections which should be a neutral description of the history and modality, especially when many of the criticisms don't apply to all naturopaths. Most of these issues should also have links to more in depth pages surrounding those issues. I've added a link for vaccines, and I know there are well written pages for others. 'Alternative Cancer Treatments' and 'List of herbs with known adverse effects', are two pages which seem quite comprehensive, with a fair degree of scientific rigour. 

 ===Diagnosis=== 

 I'm wondering if this should have a section of it's own or whether it should be regionalised. It could come partly under criticisms and controversies, and it could also come under a larger heading of the relationships between naturopaths and other medical professionals. In my course we are actively discouraged from making diagnoses, knowing when to refer to a gp or specialist can be a matter of life and death at times, and can require insistence, especially as many natural health clients are somewhat cautious of their local gp. This is also the other side the correlation surrounding low vaccination rates in natural health clients, and other untreated illnesses, although I'm not sure where it should fit in. 

 ===Reception=== 

 I've noticed this on other natural health pages, and I'm wondering if this should have a separate section, in terms of reception and utilisation by the public, and acceptance, or lack thereof, by governments and medical authorities. This is another thing which makes me wonder whether it would be better to split most of the article into countries and contain """"education"""", """"practitioners"""", """"methods"""", """"regulation"""", and """"reception"""" under each of those. Leaving the """"introduction"""", """"history"""", """"criticisms/controversies"""" as the only standalone sections. 

 Anyway, some of these points sort of spilled into each other, so I hope it's easy enough to see what I'm getting at. I'm already collecting a considerable amount of solid references for Australian Naturopathy, and a few for Europe. I'm wondering do I post links here in talk so they can be discussed before use in the main page?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.2980122566223145

 == Awadewit == 

 Of all the terrible things Wikipedia has introduced me to over the years, this is by far the absolute worst. Fuck you once more, Wikipedia. So hard. I do not have words sufficient to describe how awful this news is, and this stupid fucking site for making it so awful. Fuck you, Wikipedia. 

 Better I direct it to the site in general than to Awadewit, to whom I directed a good share of swearing while I was active here. I was a proficient writer when I wrote my first article here, Ann Bannon. Awadewit reviewed it, encouraged me to make it a Featured Article, then proceeded to block me at every turn so the article eventually became the most informative, authoritative account of Bannon's life available anywhere, in print or online. Awadewit blocked my first attempt to get To Kill A Mockingbird to FA status because the article just was not good enough. Harper Lee outlived Awadewit. Who could wrap their mind around such a thing?  

 Because of Awadewit, Wikipedia got an extraordinarily thorough account of the issues surrounding the Everglades. She led the FA team effort to review these articles. I was the primary writer. Her enthusiasm propelled these articles from nonexistent to FA status in eight weeks. A discussion about her dissertation led me to write the article for """"Amazing Grace"""". She encouraged me to write articles related to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. If anyone reading just snorted in derision, she suggested I rewrite them for your scorn, so that I could add serious critique to them, invalidating your snort. So fuck you too. 

 It is somehow fitting that since I left Wikipedia some of these articles have devolved into the kind of mediocrity she rejected. She became Wikipedia's champion, while I do not have a vocabulary filthy enough to impart to this site to do it the cursed justice it deserves. I logged in for the first time in more than a year to leave this message. To whom?   

 Awadewit was active in promoting women's participation here. A repeated theme in criticism directed toward Wikipedia is its collective apathy toward women's issues, both in how topics are handled in article space and how female editors are treated. Awadewit chose to focus on this when she wrote articles, and when she wrote about Wikipedia offsite. The claim that women were treated poorer than editors who identified themselves as male always mystified me. Some of the strongest editors here are womenor were when I was active. Awadewit and SandyGeorgia on their own seemed to invalidate the claim that female editors are maligned and their opinions not taken seriously. Awadewit did more to raise expectations on Wikipedia perhaps than anyone else. My writing changed because of her. I know my reading did too.

However, I see this as nothing more than a waste of time, that pulls away from the topic. For a good reason I'm sure. I think you will find I have a rather """"laser"""" like attention span.

You're being quite uncivil, and that's a recipe for disaster - go find a successful complaint against an admin, and try to find a single harsh word.  I'm not saying you're an idiot.  But you're going down a path that anyone can tell you won't end well. 

 :Pal, right now you're at a crossroads:  You're on the threshold of breaking about half a dozen behavioral guidelines.  And you're alleging admin abuse, so that's not going to go unnoticed.

 No problem, I think though the new rewording sounds a lot better and is more iinformative and I can see your points regarding the data being more suitable to be added to the depersonalisation article. Sorry if I got carried away. I usually do keep my cool on wikipedia. I think the triggering of DPD is like where someone gets really stoned either a s aonce off or a period of use or takes LSD or psylocibin a couple of times or once and then triggers depersonalisation disorder. I guess I am coming from the perspective or depersonalisation caused by a chronic insult to the nervous system, i.e. severe distortion of brain chemistry due to chronic dependence (upregulation, down regulation of transmitter systems) and/or from withdrawal. For example I have never heard of someone going and getting drunk and then waking up the next day with (triggered) depersonalisation or some other major mental health disorder but I have heard and it is well known that alcohol dependence and misuse over a prolonged period of time can cause a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infact I was talking to a psychiatrist and he said that the most common causes of depersonalisation like symptoms that he sees in his practice is either from cannabis or the consequences of alcoholism and he says as far as alcoholism he has seen people recover after up to 10 years of abstinence or in some cases never. He works with a lot of people who have mental health problems from drug abuse and/or dependence. There is no ill feeling at all from my point of view.

Hubble. F. Zwicky, L. de Broglie, W. Podolksky, K. Popper and so many others,. the same organized interests have managed for half a century to impose the validity of Einstein theories within the hyperdense media inside hadrons when these theories are inapplicable according to years of measurements within a medium as thin as our atmosphere, resulting in a clear misuse of trillions of taxpayers money the silent majority is responsible for since silence in such organized and protracted crimes against mankind are complicity, which misuse should be investigated by our Attorney general for AS,America to have a chance to survive our current financial collapse.

"The Little World Series was renamed the Junior World Series in 1931. The annual match-up between the top teams in the American Association and International League continued through 1962 (except for no series in '35), when the AA folded.

 Applications 
 Applications are too real that most of us cannot hesitate to live the life. There are so many ways to operate your InfoTech life and real people will cherish what you do or know. How many file formats of images do you know? How many sound formats do you know? Do you think it ends on mp3 and mp4? No! Are you a computer Guru who operates computer and work on so many application programs like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Adobe – PageMaker, CorelDraw, Microsoft Access and so many more like Peachtree Accounting. It’s going to be a beautiful world for you if you can figure out all these and differentiate them clearly. One can know about computer by being able to type with a glance at the keyboard but might be unable to figure out the differences. It’s obvious that in today’s world of computer many people visit the café mainly to get hot cash, but how boastful can you be. Why don’t we all “go back to what we know” and see if it’s going to fetch us good in life. Now it’s has been the chorus of the city by people that anymore Youngman who possess a laptop or desktop for his home is a Scammer. Young men like me brought this to the mind of our fellow brothers. I know I run applications but I’m proud I do because it’s part of everyday life in the aspect of talks and computers. Real people always go with real minds. One cannot open the eyes wide and sneeze simultaneously. I thank God for my life for not making me be a rat, because “House Rat is an unfortunate creature, it eats the house owner’s food and still make him wear rags” The rat does appreciate things in short the same goes to the set of people I’m talking about. “I want to create a blog that will exist after my youth and when I’m old I can make reference to it”. “It’s too good to be true” Everything I needed in life is access to information. I can promote the knowledge of our Nigerian youths. Learn computer, learn other vocations, be educated and sound in your responsibilities. Applications can be too good for a learning – ready heart.

 Oh! It's Something About Me........ 
 More than few people can talk about me. Ask why? Because it’s quite an age I have been in the midst of big time crew where real applications are run. I have been an application fella even before this present situation that made be stick to been an application runner. Now that I tried running things in the academic world and it’s been some kind of awful situation like a situation where there’s no connection there’s no way out. I run application right from the day I was born and when I grew up to this stage I discover the more application I run the more people of high caliber I meet. I’ve been to the world of academic education and music thing done in my home and all with the aid of technological innovation; computers precisely, I have been the king in all manners. For me to talk in the areas I have discussed I’m a talker not a listener anymore. Because I have discovered the ways to write beautiful and foreign RnB LYRICS that suit my taste and the taste of people like me who can cherish the words used. Being alone at the beginning of ones life, if perfectly and judiciously used one can use it to get what one needs in life and people with surely look after you and always want to be with you. Reading the books or articles you love most, listening to the kind of music you find in your father’s album shelf can later lead you to your choice of music, playing the kind of game you find educative and interesting will surely make you king. Because when you have the full details about the little within your reach you can communicate with people who have gone far but finally know little just because of their wide coverage. The more they say you look, the less you see. 

 In short, I grew up in my mother’s room with the word “I don’t want to see you out there play rough; be contented” I pick whatever item or article I have got I read and digest. I try to compare it to the real world and see how it works. I love to read things of the past and check for future possibilities. You heard about Michael Faraday. 

 Intuition was one of those things my father loved most about me. He kept on saying “how did you come about knowing it” he has always try to see me go anywhere I want to go in the learning world. I made some, some fucked me up. My first tertiary education was quite pretty good and after the break of the first two years, continuity became the problem of the seasons. I decided to stick to my computers because right from time after food, computer was always my first hobby. It became part of my red blood cells, later it started running in my blood stream.

 * WP:PEACOCK: """"powerful"""", """"agile"""", """"effective"""", """"particularly noted"""", """"like all great martial artists"""", etc. Especially bad in the lead section, which sounds like it's trying to make Choy Li Fut sound awesome (especially with the Bruce Lee quote). By contrast, the lead sections of karate, wing chun, and silat, just to give a few examples, describe those respective arts plainly. 
 * Much of the text in the article is just a list of trivial lineage information. A typical Wikipedia reader would want to know the description of the art and the history of its practice, not just a list of random names. A list of only the more notable practitioners can be split off into a separate list article (or a category) if necessary. Most of the names given in this article are not notable, nor is there any citation given for them. The article is short on actual information about Choy Li Fut's techniques and principles. Compare to Wing Chun's detailed Characteristics and Curriculum sections. 
 * Extremely dubious references: 
 :* Wong Kiew Kit, in both his books cited here, unquestioningly repeats the long-discredited Bodhidharma myth of Shaolin kung fu (see Meir Shahar's Shaolin Monastery, or Tang Hao's work on the subject). Wong also repeats the myth of Emperor Taizu of Song having created a martial art, and of Zhang Sanfeng being the founder of taijiquan. Reading around on the web, Wong seems to believe all kinds of kooky fringe stuff. He is not a reliable source for anything. 
 :* Historical lineage info from online sources that provide no documentation of their own sources. Which 19th century documents did they consult for such detailed information? Lineage fraud is common in Chinese martial arts. Where's the evidence? 
 :* The Way of the Warrior by Chris Cruddelli is used as a source for some Choy Gar info. The book only contains basic, unsourced info about various martial arts. He has two short paragraphs on the whole thing and doesn't say how he knows who the founder was. The intro to the book even says it's not necessary to be """"overly clinical"""" in addressing the differences between facts and fables. Seriously? 
 * Dubious fairy tales with intentionally misleading citations: 
 :* The cited page in the Bruce Lee book The Tao of Gung Fu does not include the details given in the paragraph about Choy Fook. 
 :* Similarly, the cited page on Barefoot Zen doesn't include any of the details of the paragraph about Choy Fook it's given as a reference for. 
 :Given the above, the entire section on Choy Fook looks like made-up bullshit to me, tarted up with a couple of references that don't back it up. At this point I'm not even convinced that Choy Fook was a real person. 
 * Although some books are cited, only a few of the citations give page numbers. Given that the two that I checked that did have page numbers were bullshit (see above), I'm extremely skeptical about the ones that don't cite any specific page numbers. 
 * There are many details about the 19th century history of Choy Li Fut that do not cite any sources. The only cited sentences in those sections pertain to general facts about that era. Where is all this information coming from?

 I have serious doubts about the failure rates associated with Lea's shield.

 == Al Masdar == 

 I am less and less attracted to this map. My last edit is probably several weeks ago old, maybe months. As long as we use Al Masdar as a direct source this map will not change, and will stay the same and outdated. Basically i just canot believe that we use a source which autor is Leith Fadel, banned 2 times from twitter for racism and fascism voice. He openly makes fun for civilians casulties, praises foreign forces in Syria (Iran/Hezbollah etc) calls for the extermination of 200k rebels in Syria, calls for killing civilians in Jisr Shugur, Qariatajn etc because they are traitors etc. Now to get back to Al Masdar. Basically, every article contains like 70% of fictinal content, which was just made up to fill in the gap, i know that because twitter users always make fun of him on twitter because he posts things which can't be theoretically true. 
 :: The best last examples are   
 *According to Al Masdar, the SAA has recaptured Jazal oilfield for 2 times already, actually they wrote 3 articles, in first they said """"SAA repeld ISIS atacks on Jazal"""", next article is """"SAA recaptured Jazal"""", next article is """"SAA recaptured Jazal area after clashes with ISIS"""".  
 *The next example is Deir Ezor. ISIS, SOHR and rebel sources said that ISIS advanced around the airport and captured some areas including the missile battalion. While Al Masdar denied any ISIS advance and said that SAA is actually advancing. Their next article is actually even more weird, they wrote """"SAA repeled ISIS attacks on the airport"""" which is contradictionary because now suddenly SAA is actually still inside the airport. To make this even worse, next Al Masdar article says that SAA recaptured the missile batalion, which is again contradictionary beacuse they said that SAA never lost it. 
 *Next example is Kanaker town south of Damascus. Al Masdar is convincing us that this town is under SAA control and always was, and now suddenly 3 years later they write an article where they say """"At least 500 rebels surender in Kanaker"""" .... i mean..... 

 :: In my opinion Al Masdar canot be used as a Direct source for edits, because their Syria articles are writen by Leith Fadel, and he basically has no idea what's happening in Syria, those who follow him on twitter know that. He was actually talking with Aris Rousinos on twitter (a guy from Vice news who was in Hasaka), and Leith Fadel was convincing him that his reports are fake and that everything what he said was a lye, YPG never captured those areas etc ... i mean ..

 :In the view of so many basic differences between the two traditions, [Jain and Vedic] it is amazing that there are still people who speak of Jainism as a “heterodox sect of Hinduism” An impartial study of the literary evidence, both Jaina and Brahamanical, leads to a conclusion that the latter offshoots of the Vedic tradition have borrowed a lot from Jainism  the theory of karma and re-birth, the vegetarianism of the higher Hindu castes, perhaps also temple worship. Page 59 
 :Jainism is one of the oldest living religions of the world. Perhaps it is the oldest living religion that has served as a major civilizing force, giving birth to roughly 2,000 years of written literature, to wonders of art and architecture, and to a system of philosophy and ethics that gave inspiration to political giant like Mahatma Gandhi. Several Religious ideas that are today considered “typically Indian”, either originated in or were spread by Jaina teachers. This ought to be common knowledge, but as with many other things in the world, this is not the case. Page 11",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.297876834869385

"==Lee Gerhard== 
 In the discussion on currentness of research, Lee Gerhard's name came up as one who might be excluded. Kim Peterson linked to a google scholar search that shows recent publications. I've looked a bit closer at these. To sum up: all his journal papers have been in AAPG Journal (American Association of Petroleum Geologists). His geo papers span 1971-82. His recent writings in the same journal have all been on arguing against Kyoto and minimizing GHGs as drivers vs. solar.  

 Here's a link to a search on the AAPG journal site showing his writings: 
 http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/search?field_name=fulltext&field;_value=&andorexacttitle;=and&author1;=gerhard&fmonth;=Mar&fyear;=1921&tmonth;=Mar&tyear;=2007&RESULTFORMAT;=1&hits;=10&sortspec;=relevance&sendit;=Search 
 His geo writings are both long ago and not related to climate (they're about finding oil, as that's the area of science this journal covers.) His recent writings don't appear to be original research on climate so much as commentary. He's definitely a skeptic, but if we were sticking to people who publish on the science of climate, I'd have trouble justifying his inclusion.  

 I read through the powerpoint linked by his entry, and he assembles lots of charts from other people's research with his own read on what they mean. Slide 23 uses a pie chart I recognize from a quite dodgy skeptic site I recently looked into, which had very fishy numbers claiming that two-thirds of the rise in CO2 from 280ppm to today's 380ppm was natural, not anthropogenic. That's just nuts of course, but it underlies the 0.28% anthropogenic share of GHEffect the pie chart claims. (95% water vapour, 4.72% volcanoes, ocean life and animals) 

 Anyway, I feel Gerhard is pretty borderline. He's still publishing, but not from direct research of his own; he's just putting up other people's graphs and discussing how he reads them.",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.237990379333496

 Since I believe that many of Wikipedia's philosophy related articles need improvement, I don't take reversing other editors' contributions lightly. There have to be multiple reasons, but mainly whether the contribution vandalizes the article, makes the article philosophically at odds with accepted professionally published sources, or less readable for casual visitors.  

 While I am delighted to encounter another person who takes as much pleasure from Plato's works as I do, I'm forced to oppose your edits on all of the above grounds. Of course, if you can find a peer reviewed professional article to support your addition, just as you have stated, then I will back off without further conditions. That cannot be your previous reference to Cooper's Introduction to the Phaedrus which is open in front of me. He says nothing about madness, (Phaedrus 244a ff). 

 Naturally, these are all based on my personal judgment. However, according to Wikipedia rules for resolving editing conflicts between editors {WP:DR}, you may not insist on changing the article over the other editor's objections, as you are doing. You need to have a consensus of other interested editors first. You don't have that.

As you said, """"in every similar situation in wrestling history"""" it goes vacant but, this situation is unique and sets a new precident.

Da li ti uopće čitaš te promjene? U cijeloj diskusiji mi nisi dao niti jedan jedini argument da moje promjene ne stoje. Po čemu sam ja odbacio sud u Hagu? Po čemu i jedna moja promjena niječe bilo što izrečeno na Haškom sudu? Za Blaškićevu presudu nisam nigdje rekao(ajde pročitaj još jedamput moje riječi!) da nije bilo zločina u Ahmićima, niti sam na nijedan način uopće spomenuo ulogu RH u cijelom sukobu. Rekao sam da se držiš izjava iz Haga bez da ih dokazuješ. Bilo je žalbi u kojima su prijašnje osude odbačene. Npr. Kupreškići. Ali sve od toga je totalno ne bitno za moje promjene! Ima 5 stvari koje uporno briseš(po 555put) 
 1) HDZ je pobjedio u većini općina koje je htio uključiti u HB (imaš rezultat izbora na linku) 
 2) za odcjepljenje i organiziranje nove vlasti je krivio neučinkovist vlasti u Sarajevu. U čemu je problem? Koja nova vlast (pogotovo ako je pučistička) ne krivi staru za sve probleme??? 
 3) HB je proglašena republikom za vrijeme Ženevskih pregovora u kojima se raspravljalo o podjeli BiH na 3 etničke republike. Plan Owen-Stoltenberg? Zar bi svaki pojedini pojam morao imati neki link? (a i linkovi koje sam ti dostavio očito nisu prekorisni jer kada si me tražio rezultate izbora, kasnije si tako i tako izbrisao rečenicu i rekao da rezultatiuopće nisu bitni (zašto si me onda tražio izvore???)) 
 4)priče o početku rata. Rat se rasplamsao nakon što je Travnički kanton dodijeljen Hrvatima i HVO pokušao očistiti A BiH iz njega, tj sukobi oko zajedničkih vojnih snaga (wance-owenow plan) 
 5)oko upotrebe simbola i novca. Na sve te simbole Hrvati su imali pravo kao konstruktivni narod, a što se novca tiče, glavna valuta je tijekom rata bila njemačka marka. Siljenje učenika drugih naroda da se pridržavaju hrvatskog kurikuluma je protuustavno, ali nisam imao vremena da to pravilno formuliram. 
 Nijedna od ovih stvari nije išla na štetu niti bosanske vlasti niti u opravdavanje HBa. Sve stvari opisuju stanje kakvo je bilo na području HBa, od naseljavanja izbjeglica pa na dalje. Jedina stvar koja bi eventualno mogla biti sporna je dio o 'hrvatskom strahu' ali to također još nema ispravnu formulaciju. Svaka promjena je u skladu s NPOV wikipedinom politikom, a ne vidim zašto bi za svaku od ovih stvari morao postojati konkretan link! Minimalno 10 puta sam te pozvao da mi pomogneš oko formulacije svake od navedenih stvari umjesto da ih samo obrišeš! O kakvom doljevanju ulja na vatru govoriš? Ajde daj pročitaj još jedanput NPOV politiku [], da li u njoj piše da smiješ citirati tuđe mišljenje, bez da se slažeš s njime???  Dio sa generalizacijom hrvatskog mišljenja je možda moja greška, ali nikako ne uspjevam naći ispravnu formulaciju za situaciju u kojoj 80-90% biračkog tijela bira pripadnike jedne stranke čije je službeno mišljenje takvo i takvo! Prepucavanje i flip-flop oko neke stranice ne vodi apsolutno ničemu, a pogotovo ne koristi wikipedije. Mislim, koja ti je stvar vraćati sve na staro usprkos svakom dokazu? Na samom početku diskusije si me tražio izvore za rezultate izbora 1990, ja ti ih pošaljem, a ti svejedno izbrišeš rečenicu za koju si tražio potkrijepu?? Ajde molim te probaj malo to pročitati i razmisliti o svemu rečenomu. Niti jedna od mojih namjera nije bila loša niti služi za nametanje tuđeg mišljenja, niti opravdanju HBa(milijunti put!) već proširenju konteksta. I ne shvaćam zašto pričaš o izjavama iz bosanskih medija, niti kako bi nešto bilo drugačije da navedeš, makar kao izvor neku od tih izjava. Koja je razlika između rečenice 'the Herzeg-Bosnian leadership is presently awaiting trial at the ICTY on charges including Crimes Against Humanity' i navođenja konkretne optužbe za zločin? Svaki zločin bez obzira na nacionalnost treba biti kažnjen. Zar su crvena krvna zrnaca nekog zato što je jedne nacionalnosti imuna na ratne zločine??

 == I could have been. == 

 Had I taken an interest in Japanese culture (and Anime) earlier in life (particularly, the 7th Grade or sooner), then due to the immense turmoil at school through having a paraprofessional that year, I would have ran away to the West Coast, so I could sneak aboard a ship to Japan, and find a better life there. 

 In fact, I plan on sending to my former High School Counselor my thoughts on this """"what if"""" issue, so she can tell me what her thoughts are about this.  

 It may have been good to not run away, or it may have been good to do so and reach Japan (if circumstances and fate allowed for it). Regardless, I felt a great portion of my youth was wasted because of that year. Gone, at least 'til the day Dechronification comes along. 

 The Letter: 

 ''Dear Sue, 

 I am glad Mrs. Terri Miller gave me your email address at the Pizza Hut. College is fun and challenging at the same time. What has Chapman been like? 
 Now, I think it is time to get this “fantasy” out of the system. I regret not discussing this with you earlier, mainly because it did not cross my mind until after I reached college. 
 Remember when I had Mrs. Potter back in 7th Grade and how that school year was the most miserable ever for me? 
 Well what if the following happened: 

  
 December 1st, 1997 

 Mr. Sanborn tells me that it is a fact that Mrs. Potter will be with me for the rest of the school year, and that any further complaints about her will send me to ISS. Mrs. Potter tells me that now, she will be around me no matter what- whether I am good or not, she will be in all of my classes. The next day, I am to serve I.S.S. for whatever reason there was that day.  
 One thing is for sure- if Mrs. Potter were not there, I would not have had to serve it. Because of her, I got into a lot more trouble than other students did, even though they did many of the same things but got away with it. She was also ruining my reputation, which meant ruining plenty of chances to get a girlfriend, because fellow students would always see Mrs. Potter following me around, and to every class. 

 Once I get home, I decide, “I don’t need any more of her draconian authority. If this country does not care enough about the well-being and reputation of a kid they educate, then why do I need to stay here? If my parents love me, then why don’t they either remove Mrs. Potter or take me to a different school? I have reason to believe that I am not loved enough around here, so you know what? I am running away. Where to? I will reveal it down below. 

 With a pencil and paper, I plan my runaway. Factoring in the cold December weather, I put down what I need- 
 -Only one backpack 
 -Up to four waist packs 
 -Up to four of Dad’s spare wallets 
 -Wear three layers of sweaters, with one t-shirt innermost 
 -Wear 2 layers of sweatpants, with jeans as the third layer, belt included 
 -Wear ski mask 
 -Wear coat 
 -Wear three layers of socks 
 -Wear Gloves 
 -In available storage areas, put in 
 One Extra sweater 
 One Extra Pants 
 Three Extra undergarments 
 Two Extra pairs of socks 
 -Toiletries 
 -Toothbrush & Toothpaste 
 -Dental Floss 
 -Inhaler 
 -Trapper Keeper 
 -Some Game CDs 
 -Flashlight 
 -Battery-Laden Alarm Clock 
 -Easily Storable Food & Drink to fit the rest of the spaces 
 (Remember: This is not just a backpack; I will also have four waist packs, AKA waist pouches, so I can have the extra storage space that I need.) The next step is to find as much money as possible. That night, assume I find ~$350 from around the house, mostly from parents’ wallets. Yes, it would have been stealing, but it would not matter if I were running away to never come back. Then all of that money goes into the wallets. 
  	 Once I am done gathering and putting together all that’s needed to run away, I decide that Japan is a good place. All the technology, high life, Anime, and the abundance of girls! Some Youth Hostel could take care of me well there, too. Now how do I run away to Japan? There happens to be a Greyhound Bus station in Junction City. They can take me to Seattle. What if I need parental or a guardian’s permission, being 12 years old? No problem; I forge a note. I get another sheet of paper and write the following: 
 “Dear Greyhound, 
 My Nephew, Chris Cuervo, will rejoin his parents back in Seattle. We had a pleasant time with him but now is the time to send him back. Ensure he is safe during his trip home! 
 Sincerely, 
 Madeline Cuervo” 

  	 Then the note gets folded, and put inside one of the knapsacks. 12-year-olds usually do not have any ID. I would probably leave behind my Military ID card, though. You get those when you are 10 if you are a military family member",0,0,0,0,0,0,6.504328727722168

"== Origin of the name Bilbo == 

 This is a query I have related to another article and maybe you, Tolkien enthusiasts, may help. 

 The name bilbo appears in classical English as a type of sword (see Bilbo (sword)), which is mentioned by Shakespeare's character Pistol in the Merry Wives of Windsor: 
 :Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine, 
 :I combat challenge of this latten bilbo. 
 :Word of denial in thy labras here! 
 :Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!  
 and is ethymologically linked to the Basque city of Bilbao (also known as Bilbo by locals and Bilboa in old English) 

 My question is: does anybody know for sure (and can document somehow) if Tolkien's name choice for this character was inspired by these cultural references (sword, Shakespeare)? I feel it's probably the case but I'd like to have more definite information, thanks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,4.944334506988525

"""All the sources say it that the Serbs viewed it that way, because of Milosevic's propaganda aimed to start a war in Croatia and to create greater-Serbia. We are going in circles because you are not willing to discuss in good faith. The bottom line is that you claim the Serbs had and lost constitutive status without being able to define the term or to point to the primary source to sustain your suggestion. The other side on the other hand had both defined the term and referenced the primary source. Since you aren't willing to discuss in good faith and since you provided no new arguments during this RfC I suggest we collect the arguments and the sources like in the 1st post and let other experienced editors decide. It's impossible to reach a consensus with someone who is not discussing in good faith. And you pretty much deferred all other editors from this RfC except for me and Director. If he had not shown up, it would end up your way just because of your disruptive behavior that makes people don't care what the article says, just that they don't have to deal with you. You posted a lot of comments without a single new argument and you are trying to push your way against the sources. Your behavior was so disruptive behavior that people rather left the discussion and left the article says 2 conflicting statements in 2 consecutive sentences, than to discuss with you. And this is not your fist time as I can see. I'm looking at your contributions and almost every discussion involving you ends up with a RfC and you constant disruptive behavior. You are constantly trying to ban other people that don't agree with you. There's a written trace to your behavior and it's a shame no one reviewed it.

That is why you are being ignored by everyone.  Anyway, this discussion is near over, and it is only Direktor and me still participating.  You desperately called for Joys help but he didn't gave it to you cause Joy is an administrator here and a senior editor who knows to recognize the situation.  Gregor is in my view the finest Croatian editor, initially seems he didn't knew about my sources, but after seeing them he left the discussion by saying that the change in the constitution should be mentioned.  Then Tuvixer who was the editor who first started opposing the denial that was being made by an already senior, but well known as nationalist, editor Shokatz.  And now there is Direktor, my well known college from discussions, the two of us have already discussed here on talk-pages during almost a decade more lines than probably all the books you read in your life. Direktor isn't indeed a Croatian nationalist, and he is participating here because of 2 reasons: he saw here a great opportunity of having a challenging discussion in which he could make use of his argumentative skills which are excellent, and because despite not being a nationalist, he does have some strong pro-Croatian views in the matters of Serbian-Croatian disputes.  He also knows how Serbian arguments about the 1990s are usually weak in sources, not because they may be right or wrong, but because the West backed up quite strongly the anti-Serb rhetoric and, as we are at English Wiki preferably working with English-language sources, that rhetoric ends up usually being easily found.  However, this case is different and the situation was noticed by some editors which know the danger of opposing sources without anything substantial.  You obviously seem not to care about your reputation, otherwise you wouldn't lie as you are doing in this last comments.  Not long ago, you criticized the fact that senior editors have more weight that newcomers (you).  That may seem an unfair situation, but it really isn't, and I will explain you why.

 ==legal fiction== 
 Concerning """"a legal fiction""""; were I the original author, I might choose to open the article with a tone less aggressive and more informative to the layperson. """"Legal fiction"""" is a term of art.  I don't believe it should be the """"definitional headline."""" It is; however, accurate.  Restatement (Second) of Torts §283 comment c (1965) (""""The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard."""")  In Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490 the """"legal fiction"""" is implied. First, when the jury was instructed that the defendant was required to have acted as a """"prudent man"""" would have acted under those circumstances.  And then under review, the directive was deemed too vague.  Further, it was determined that a defendant acting honstly and bona fide to the best of his own judgement would afford no rule at all and leave open infinitely variable individual judgement. Nuance aside, the foundation for the """"legal fiction"""" for the basis of comparison exists. The """"reasonable person"""" is a fact assumed or created by courts.    

 To eliminate the """"citation needed"""" might I suggest: 
 * Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1119 (where """"reasonable man"""" is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed) 
 * Camplin [1978] A.C. 705 (a reasonable man """"means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today"""") 
 * R v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 (citing Champlin and Bedder: a preasonable man """"is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; and that the question is not merely whether such a person would in like circumstances be provoked to lose his self-control but also whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did"""") 
 That said, I maintain that a citation is of modest benefit if not entirely unnecessary. From conceptual inception, the question has never been """"is the 'reasonable person' fictional?"""" I submit the question has always been, 'Is a reasonable person defined in accordance with a particular normative ethical commitment or in accordance with an empirically observed practice or perception?' I posit that a reasonable person, possessed of minimal education, should have little difficulty exploring the nature of """"legal fiction"""" (given the link) were they so inclined.

The Oosttaverne Line was easily reached but on the Wambeek brook, 1,000 yards north of the intended position. The Auatralians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet trying to meet the 33rd Brigade. The brigade arrived at 4:30 p.m. with four tanks and took Joye and Van Hove Farms beyond the objective to silence German machine-guns there. 

 On the IX Corps front a brigade from the 11th Division was ordered to advance to Vandamme Farm at 9:25 a.m. but the mesage was delayed and the troops did not reach the assembly area at Rommens Farm until 3:50 p.m., half an hour late. To cover the delay the corps commander ordered the reserve brigade of the 19th Division to take the Oosttaverne Line from from Van Hove Farm-Oosttaverne village-Bug Wood so that only the southern 1,200 yards of the objective was left for the 33rd Brigade. These orders were also delayed and the 19th Division commander asked for a postponement then ordered the 57th Brigade to advance without waiting for the 33rd Brigade. The troops only knew that they were to advance downhill and keep up to the barrage but were able to occupy the objective in 20 minutes against light opposition, meeting the Australians at Polka Estaminet. 

 Two brigades of the 24th Division advanced into the  X Corps sector and reached Damm Strasse on time. The brigades reached their objectives easily around Bug Wood, Rose Wood and Verhaest Farm, tanking many German pillboxes unopposed. 289 Germans and six field guns were captured for a loss of six casualties in an 800 yards advance along the Roozebeek valley. Ravine Wood on the left was also taken unopposed and the extreme left of the advance was drawn back to meet the 47th Division which was still held up by machine-gun fire from the Spoil Bank.

 ::Verifiability is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inclusion.  And since reliable sources can sometimes conflict with one another, sources must be weighed in context.  In short, just because you can find a cite for something, doesn't mean it automatically merits inclusion in wikipedia.  """"Pasta is made out of wheat"""" is a true verifiable statement, but it doesn't belong in this article.  """"There's a sea monster in Loch Ness"""" can be easily sourced, but that doesn't mean we should uncritically re-state it, even though many sources say this.  In other words, it may not be our job to determine what's a misconception and what isn't, but it is our job to weigh reliable sources. 

  
 ::From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources: 
 :::The reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made and is the best such source for that context. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article, and should be appropriate to the claims made. If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it...   
 :::Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. This means that we only publish the opinions of reliable authors, and not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read and interpreted primary source material for themselves. 

 ::Here, we have two style-guides from minor universities making a claim.  Who actually wrote the articles?  Were they peer-reviewed, or otherwise edited?  Or were they just posted by a part time summer intern?  We have no way of knowing. Meanwhile, we can't turn up even a single source of someone actually making the claim """"hyhens and dashes are the same"""". Again, I ask the question: if this misconception is so common, why are there no examples of it? That's truly puzzling, don't you think?  The Loch Ness Monster analogy above is apt -  we have two sources saying that something exists, but nobody can come up with an example in the wild. 
 ::So, I question the reliability of the sources, but not strongly enough to remove the entry as unsourced.  

 ::To answer your questions: 1) Unlike the previous cites, the two new cites contain wording that is sufficient to base the article on.  I question whether these sources are sufficiently reliable.  3) I am not """"bent"""" on removing this section; before today I thought it was unsourced since it required interpretation to get from what was written in the source to what was in the article, now I think it is sourced but question how reliable those sources are. Aside from the verifiability issue, there's the editorial decision of whether the entry makes sense in the context of the rest of the article - my view as an editor is that it sticks out like a sore thumb as distinctly different than the other entries on the page.

I began to realize that, for me, the nasty truth was that much of it was a power trip. Oh, don’t get me wrong: my actions were taken because, in part, I did truly believe that the articles I nominated didn’t belong. But it was indeed a manifestation of a darker side of me — I enjoyed the fact that I could hurt someone — make them angry and mad and defensive. Because in my real life, that’s not something I do. I’m Mister Friendly with nearly everyone I meet, and I’m actually a really nice guy in about 99% of circumstances. But something about the process brought out the worst in me — aggression and adrenaline, all funneled through a keyboard without danger of being punched in the face. Resisting the temptation to say “fuck you, fanboy,” and instead turning it into a passive-aggressive “I truly believe that your article is not notable, and would remind you that Wikipedia has policies regarding not attacking your fellow editors and being civil to them” (ah, did I have a gift for the bull-lingo) ...I got a dark thrill out of seeing people froth and rage and turn into drooling rabid ready-for-heart-attack messes because they weren’t getting the fight they wanted out of me. And another side of me looked at that dark thrill and went, “What the fuck are you doing, Mike?”

The Besson part fits best in the Critical reception section, where similar comparisons are being made, and, in that source, he does not call those matters (his intention of blending the aforementioned three films) as themes of Lucy. The Critical reception section is not """"rapidly becoming an overly large Critical reception""""; it has been stable for weeks, and it covers just about all that needs to be covered regarding critical reception to the film. Furthermore, various Wikipedia film articles have a Critical reception section that is of five or six paragraphs long, including Avatar (2009 film)#Critical reception. Some even have subsections. The Telegraph bit is currently cutting into a paragraph that is about comparing the film to other films and characters; so it's a little misplaced as it is, though Betty did a decent job of fitting it in that section. I might make a Themes section, if I come across WP:Reliable sources (as in more than one) noting that they are discussing the themes.

 :You have no right to """"insist"""" on anything, particularly a POV-pushing agenda to focus excessively on the state of Nevada (or Texas, for that matter). What you originally inserted into the article was several different edits that contained various content, most of which was irrelevant or inaccurate. Your new proposal is not acceptable because it puts undue weight on Nevada and the """"we must use all sources"""" argument is absurd, we could easily add five more books; Dobie's """"guess"""" is the outlier, and we don't need a bunch of other in-between guesses for here or there. All sources are not created equal and the 100,000 in Nevada is IRRELEVANT to the legislation. (Please read WP:UNDUE) I also took a look at your single legitimate original point - that the five million number in Evans seemed dodgy, and I agreed with you on that point, we are using the Dobie number simply because is so widely disseminated that it needs to be mentioned in a proper context.  Your edits to the lead, your rambling edits about Texas, and your """"extrapolation"""" of a wholly made up number (the 200,000 nonsense) was poorly done and inaccurate. At this point, I already proposed material on the BLM numbers of 1971 for the """"Implementation"""" section, where I think it fits. I would not object to some comment as to current numbers being added there and you can even say that the majority today are in Nevada if the stats verify that ( The language of the history section where Dobie is mentioned now is short, consied and puts Dobie's comment in context.

 #Should we add info on the numbers the BLM found in the 1971 census?  I say yes if done concisely and properly sourced.   
 #If so, should we add the wording """" A census of animals in 1971 determined that there were approximately 17,300 horses and 8,045 burros found on lands subject to the Act.(ref to myths source already in article)."""" as I proposed above for the first paragraph of the """"implementation"""" section?  I like it, but am open to better ideas or improved, if brief phrasing.   
 #Should we add ANYTHING about estimates from Nevada circa 1900?  I say no, it's irrelevant because those numbers are guesses as much ad Dobie's, and unless we want to go on and make a chart of something that contains Orgon, Wyoming, etc., it's just trivia.   
 #Should we add any other estimates besides Dobie's 2 million number?  Maybe if there is another similarly respected source with an overall estimate (If Amaral estimates for the entire west, or if Ryden has numbers, I'd be interested in seeing these.) but I don't see a need for a laundry list, particularly one that is only for one state.

 == New physical knowledge == 

 Hi Folks! 

 I did some research on physics. So, here it goes: 

 - Invisibility uses no fiber optics. It is simply not possible. You'd have to do it in all directions and that is - say - out of reach of even today's tech. 

 - Solution A: Bending light - could be possible, but would require more energy that the sun's gravity. Forget it. 

 - Solution B: Every object has an electromagnetical field. Since atoms are both atomic and electromagnetic of nature, (just like light) you can only see light in the same phase, like you. (Ever watched Stargate?) So: shifting phase should render any object invisible. Reports say, that many ships around the U.S.S. Eldridge had em generators on board. These generators were bombarding the Eldridge with low energy, high frequency em-waves. This could have had the result, that the ship became invisible. Many reports state, that people fully controlling their auras, (em-fields) have the ability to become invisible as well. 

 

 :In my research, I didn't find any specific claims for how the effect was created technically, and likely wouldn't have paid much attention to them if I had.  Rather than speculate, we should probably stick to the supposed story here, and present the opposing points of view based on that. -  scooter, you're story is base soley on your opinion and is completely open for blasting out of the water given the number of incorrect details, bad dates, false names, insufficient research and I can go on. Rip em up lydexia. As the man below states, this article should never have been written.  

 :Ah, so you're saying that all light is just tunnelling past the ship?  Read my contributions.   
 :Since atoms are both atomic and electromagnetic of nature, (just like light) you can only see light in the same phase, like you. (Ever watched Stargate?) Unless you're using some new definition of the word """"phase"""" that I haven't heard of yet, this is patently untrue, Star Trek and Stargate notwithstanding.    
 
 David, this is patently not soI just looked at your bioa recent  high school grad with interest in tecnology.  Please do some research. Lysdexia is not talking about electromagnetic vs. atomic, s/he is simply stating that when disharmonies exist between waveforms, light and light refractions disappear or become invisible. I don't think you are talking about the same thing.  And, I believe s/he is correct in stating that it is a possible outcome.  It is also true that when waveforms are sped up, the visible light disappears.  If the ship was blasted by several other ship with high speed energy thereby increasing the frequency of the light reflected from the ship, the ship could disappear.  It may even be able to move. You do not know for certain that this is not possible. 

 I'm sorry but this demonstrates a pitiful comprehension of physics.  This entire thing is conceptually just bullshit.  Science fiction != reality. 

  
 Sorry to Chime in on your article, but where did you do this physics research?  Where you differ from fact mostly is in the possibility of invisibility, specifically: 
 * Recent expierience done at the University of Michagan have shown that metamaterials (hybrid materials of composite ceramic and fabric, generally) can bend elements of the electromagnetic spectrum around them to produce what amount to limited invisibility.  This means you can be invisible on radar, to human eyes, or both.  But you will case a very small shadow as well. 
 * You say that bending light would require more energy than the suns gravity.  This is not the case.  Light bends (ever so slightly) as it goes around any object with mass, like y",0,0,0,0,0,0,5.719193935394287

For many mutazila the idea of God committing acts of injustice was repugnant; furthermore, for God to allow confusion of identity for whatever reason was irrational and inadmissible. It is therefore not God who caused that but the Jews who took another person themselves and killed him not letting people to come close and see what's going on.

 So.. let's do the postmortem.  Forgive me if you're explained some of this somewhere above  the amount of discussion this has generated is quite difficult to wade through.   
 - 
 ====The Discussed Issues==== 
 (not in same order as above posts) 
 # The Block (1995) Quote:   I disagree with Alienus I don't think the pre-print status makes it unquotable I know _technically_ that's a rule I read somewhere, but still.  If we decide we like the quote, with one email, we could verify it.  I don't overwhelmingly object to the quote (it is factual), but isn't it just Block quoting Dennett about what we're already quoted him?     
 # Materalism vs Physicalism.  I personally see nothing in Dennet's definition that makes me think he is using the technical """"matter-only"""" version of materialism.  I don't know that I've ever personally bumped into anyone who used that sense, but then, i'm not a philosopher by trade.  The most common name for the physicalism philosphy is """"materialism""""  even more common than the word """"physicalism"""".  Do you really think Dennett believes in at type of Cartesian physicalism that there really is someplace within in the brain where it all comes together, but that that place just involves electricity and/or quantum effects?  Seriously?  I'm very sympathetic to wanting to get your opinion in.  I realize the article as it current stands is VERY pro-Dennett, and I definitely want to get around to all the arguments both against dennett's reasoning, for CM, and for dualism.  Truth be told, I hate Dennett's take on consciousness.  BUT  do you really think Dennnett believes in Cartesian Physicalism, but not Cartesian Materialism?  That there's some place in the brain where everything is stored, but since it uses ENERGY instead of just pure matter, it's not TECHINCALLY materialism?   If you sincerely believe that, then I'm do apologize for not gettting into it here.   
 # Representationalism.   Why the war on this one.  Do we really believe Cartesian Materialism is NOT a kind of Representationalism?  Do we just disagree that the definition overly equates Representationalism with CM? or do we just stylistically believe the article shouldn't get into that.  
 # The """"plenum"""" quote.  I thought we agreed that it wasn't a good candidate for this page and maybe belonged better on Dennett or some other page ?  I see it's re-entered into the edit war. 
 # About Global Workspace theory  don't throw something that big in without talking about it not in a truce as finicky as this.   
 #Furthermore  Arguments FOR CM go in the """"Arguments For"""" section, yes?  For all the arguments we have for CM being made on the talk page, the section the go in is sparse.    
 # I'm not going to sort through all the edits to find out what happened to it, but there was a really super straw man sentence that was part of the compromise for using Dennett's definition.  If you guys both agree it was bad, by all means take it out, but the term """"Straw Man"""" argument comes up a LOT in discussioning CM (O&O; have a review of some of the straw man accusations in the intro to their paper), and it seems like a good part of a compromise.   
 

 ====The Important Things==== 

 *NOTHING another person can do on wikipedia justifies incivility or personal attacks.  NOTHING.  You don't just hurt the other person, you hurt the whole project.

 Regarding Bliss and March, I'm not sure there's a single online source that references all that information. Essentially, the temporary ranks of general and lieutenant general were only authorized in the National Army, which was the conscript/volunteer force authorized by emergency legislation for World War I (the equivalent of the World War II Army of the United States). Only two temporary generals were actually authorized for the National Army, so when Bliss was replaced by March as chief of staff, Bliss was made a brevet general to maintain his four-star status for the duration of the war (which I guess made him a temporary temporary general). The National Army was disestablished on June 30, 1920 by the Army Reorganization Act of that year, and the general and lieutenant general ranks went with it. Pershing only got to keep his rank thanks to special Congressional legislation that commissioned him a permanent general in the Regular Army. See the following articles from the NYTimes free archive: 

  

  

  

 Bliss and March retired as major generals, but were advanced to general on the retired list in 1930, when Congress passed legislation that restored all retired officers to their highest wartime ranks.

 :::Thanks to YouTube, I've just listened again to Pete Seeger in 1963 and, to tell you the truth, I'm not wholly convinced. He seemed to think it was 'rwm' as in cwm! And a non-native listener could go either way on that one - either towards rim or towards rum! We all agree that both The Byrds and Judy Collins got it equally wrong in the 1960s. And 1960s UK folkie Mick Softley also got it wrong. In 1970s John Denver went straight for rim, even when performing in the UK. As do the Oysterband as recently as last year. Even Show of Hands go for a Seeger-esque rwm. Only Rhyl's Mike Peters of The Alarm seems to get it right. There must be countless other recorded versions from both sides of the pond. The leading rhyme of """"give me"""", of course, could easily sway a non-Welsh singer. A listener mght even think they were the sad bells of Rimini.

 == A few thoughts == 

 Before even attempting to approach this subject, folks should consider a few things. 

 * Where do bite statistics come from? As in, expert analysis and DNA testing or """"by gum officer, it wuz one a them pit bullys!""""? 

 The CDC can collect """"statistics"""" all day but if the underlying data is provided by uninformed, untrained """"eye witnesses"""", it won't amount to a hill of beans. 

 * Hysteria really does happen.  

 Look up """"satanic ritual abuse"""" even here on Wikipedia. I remember when that flap came to my town. People totally up in arms about something for which there hasn't been a single shred of evidence. Lives were ruined, millions spent in cases such as the McMartin pre-school circus trial, and there simply was no """"there"""" there.  

 Far as dogs go, I'm old enough to remember when The Big Scary Bad Dog That'll Eat Your Children was the German Shepard. Same stories, different breed. Everybody had """"statistics"""" and """"he turned on me for no reason!"""" stories. Then, for a while, it was the Rottweiler. And for a while, the Doberman had his turn. Notice, however, it's never the big, fluffy, pretty dogs with the big brown eyes (despite the fact that Chows tend to be exceedingly temperamental and I'd never own one again myself... I'll take a pit over a Chow any day). 

 * Hysteria sells papers. 

 """"There may be a killer in your home right now!"""" 

 """"Details at 11."""" 

 Come on people, the boogeyman gets ratings and sells papers. Do you really expect to see (many) articles or TV news stories of... 

 """"You probably shouldn't own a dog because you don't care enough to educate yourself on how to properly socialize and train a dog nor do you have the sense to realize dogs aren't stuffed animals."""" 

 Yeah our media could bother to do some real education but it's more profitable to scare people into hiking their skirts and running around shrieking in terror (for details, see the current US administration). 

 * Dogs don't get to testify in court. 

 As in do you really believe a dog owner is going to tell the police, """"well, I was giving the dog his daily beating when, for no reason at all, he turned on me.""""? We have no way to verify the stories. I take all """"the dog turned on me for no reason"""" stories with a grain of salt. At least until we have some way of getting the dog's side of the story.  

 * Temperament testing 

 As in here. The ATTS gives the American Pit Bull Terrier a rating of 84.1%. The Golden Retriever obtains 83.8%. So where are all the stories of Golden Retrievers unexpectedly """"turning on"""" their owners? Or assaulting people left and right? Why aren't they being banned?  

 Because they're pretty? 

 The Cocker Spaniel obtains 81.7% but they're pretty too so they must not attack people. The Collie, 79.2%. In short, Lassie is more likely to attack you than a Pit.  

 * Sometimes the bias really is on the other side 

 I see a lot of hand waving here about the bias of the article but nobody stops to consider that """"fair and balanced"""" can be taken to such an extreme that it entails destroying the truth. Sometimes, people really are full of horse droppings and to try to """"balance"""" reality is to do harm. And """"balance"""" with what? Urban legend? Yellow journalism? Self-reported """"statistics"""" that nobody bothers to verify?  

 * Your neighbor is a bigger risk to you than his dog 

 Yes, I own pits. Both rescue dogs. One was abused by his first owner. And, frankly, I like my dogs better than I like most of you. My dogs don't get addicted to crack and try to break into someone's house unlike some neighbors I've had. 

 Dogs aren't that complicated nor that hard to socialize and train if you bother to realize that they are actual living beings and not something to compliment the drapes. My Pits are loyal, affectionate, well behaved dogs. Even the one that had to be rescued from an abusive owner. That one took actual effort (heaven forbid... work!) to socialize after being traumatized by his first owner. Today, he's the most affectionate, playful, well behaved dogs I've ever owned. 

 We don't have a """"breed specific"""" problem, we have a human problem. As in stupid, small minded, ignorant people who want a dog as a toy or decoration. Such as my alcoholic, irresponsible, mooching off his mother, former neighbor that wanted a """"tough dog"""" when he shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near a dog. Worse still, he has a kid. That'll turn out well. 

 He was a classic example of the kind of person that was going to show up in the news one day saying, """"The dog turned on me for no reason."""" When the truth was, the dog would",0,0,0,0,0,0,3.834564447402954

 This request seems to be based on exactly the sort of misconception that [[Wikipedia:official names]] seeks to address.    

 Ooh, look. And here too: 

 You seem not to understand the [[WP:AT|article naming policy]] with regard to ''official'' names. See [[Wikipedia:official names]] for an informal explanation. I referred you to both of these before.    

 Here's the facts: 

 * No one (that means you) has demonstrated that the article should be moved, either by establishing that """"US Cellular Center"""" is the name most commonly used, or in any other way established by policy. 
 * You've been referred to official policy summaries on the matter and have yet to even attempt to explain how your motion for a move comports with them. Now you're playing dumb and denying that you were ever referred to those policies. 
 * There is no reason to believe that anyone will be """"confused"""" by the name of the article. We have a notice at the top of the article for the Iowa venue, and the Asheville venue article lists the official name. It's been three months since the thing was officially renamed. Moving per WP:OFFICIALNAMES is premature in the extreme, in my opinion. 

 That last bit bears repeating  we only have three months to go on as to what the common name of the venue now is. It is entirely possible that, in the future, the official name will be the common name. As of now, however, you have not demonstrated that, nor have you seemingly made any attempt to. 

 I'm trying really hard not to be rude, but I (and I think Andrewa as well) would appreciate some reciprocation in regard to you actually reading the things we refer you to, and intelligently laying out how your vision for the article best comports with policy. Evanh2008, Super Genius

 In light of the implied sins of omission on the parts of Harris (for not relying on improved targeting methods) and his superiors like Churchill (for not ordering Harris to rely on improved targeting methods), the British manner of passive voice creates some confusion with the closing phrase """"nor were there serious misgivings about the campaign expressed at the time.""""

 == Your question at RfA == 

 Thanks for noting your concerns regarding the Phil Jones article. Unfortunately , to put the discussion in context requires a back story—a long simmering debate about the propriety of types of sources (blogs, opinion columns, news reports, science articles, and peer-reviewed science articles). I considered summarizing the positions of those with whom I am debating, but I think that's unfair, as I may get some details wrong, so, if I may, I'll briefly summarize my position on some of the issues: 
 # In science articles, peer-reviewed science articles are the gold standard. 
 # In science articles, other sources are acceptable although almost never blogs, as the usage of blogs is quite restricted, and it is not easy to image how they could be used in a pure science article). 
 # One reason for using a source other than a peer-reviewed science article is that peer-reviewed science article sometimes lapse into jargon, and other sources, such as science articles or new reports may be written in a way that is better for our audience, with the critical caveat that if a new report or science article is in dispute with a peer-reviewed science article, the peer-reviewed science article almost always wins. (Rare exceptions, such as when a non-peer-reviewed article notes an error in a peer-reviewed source, and virtually all agree that the peer-reviewed source is mistaken.) 
 # The strong preference for peer-reviewed science articles is less compelling for articles which are not squarely science articles, such as bios of scientists, and articles about the political, commercial, and other aspects related to science questions. (If such an article makes a scientific statement, then the preference for peer-reviewed science articles remains, but in other areas, we apply the ordinary rules.) 

 Sorry for that long background. 

 The Phil Jones (climatologist) article is about a scientist, not a science article. Many aspects of the dispute relate to some editors acting as if it were a science article, insisting that statements in news stories ought to be dismissed. 

 The quote in question comes from the BBC. Not all Reliable Sources are equal, but I trust that the BBC is considered one of the highest quality sources. It is my opinion that in a science article, if we had a statement from the BBC and a statement form a peer-reviewed science article, we would generally default to the peer-reviewed science article (although we might decide to include both and note the discrepancy.) However, the article in question is not a science article. I was quite unhappy that some were attempting to dismiss a quote from the BBC. In addition, part of the """"argument"""" for dismissing the quote is that some editors have personal expertise in the field, and didn't agree with the substance of the statement. Sorry, that isn't how WP works. We don't permit expert to use their personal judgment to override a quote from a scientist. We do welcome expertise - but that expertise could be used to point to relevant documents on the subject, to clarify what a scientist means when they use technical terms so that editors weighing in can make a good judgment about how to use a quote, but we don't permit experts to tell us that the scientist didn't really mean what he plainly stated. If the scientist made a mistake (and that can happen), the BBC is perfectly able to follow up with a correction, or the scientist can follow up with a correction (here is a case where a blog statement might be acceptable). 

 In short, it was my view that certain editors were attempting to suppress a quote in the BBC, simply because that quote didn't fit with their narrative. 

 Could I have done a better job making my case? Almost certainly so. I've reread much of the exchange, and I confess, a couple times, I had to pause and think about what point I was trying to make. I can only assume those I was debating may well have not fully understood my point, so that may have lead to a higher ratio of heart to light that is desirable. 

 Sorry for the length of this comment. I do not like when articles include bad sources to accomplish a POV, nor do I like when good sources are removed to meet a particular POV. This is a perfect example where WP fails our audience. A reader seeing a discussion about the issue may well come to this article, and will be puzzled to see no discussion of it. I think we can do better. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.463097095489502

 :::Illythr, I think the suggestion of naming the cat after the SSR was the simplest one (and Dc created it any way); the problem is with the ubercategory for Bessarabia and Bukovina. In what concerns the category on Moldavia, it is connected to the Moldova categories, though not ideally so - if it were after me, I'd include all the categories on Moldova into the Bessarabia subcat, going by the Moldavia>Bessarabia>Moldova system, but I can see why others would object. In any case, let's leave that discussion for later. Note: I don't object to also having articles on the history of Moldova (whether within or parallel to the """"Moldavia"""" cats), though again the system created there by Dc is chaotic and highly repetitive.

Third quotation is not from a reliable source, which is a good thing, since it's baloney.

 That's right, Terminal and non-terminal functions only handles CFL (without saying so, as many wikipedia articles do). It is mainly about parse trees and uses some unusual notation (viz. """"function"""", which occurs neither nor the only source , nor in the parse tree article). Maybe a sentence that nonterminal symbols and terminal symbols correspond to interior and leaf nodes in a CFG parse tree, respectively, could be used. And the example from the picture seems more understandable (everyone who learned English grammar might have seen such a tree) than the  example (which doesn't fit the previous grammar definition but uses some unexplained extensions for optionality and repetition). 

 It could look like this (wording subject to improvements): 

  
 . Nonterminal symbols and terminal symbols correspond to interior and leaf nodes, respectively.]] 
 As an example, consider the following context-free grammar for simple English sentences. 
 N = { S, NP, VP, Det, N, V, ... }, 
 Σ = { John, ball, hit, the, ... }, 
 start symbol is S, 
 P is as follows: 

 S   := NP VP | ... 
 VP  := V NP  | ... 
 NP  := Det N | ... | John | ... 
 N   := ball | ... 
 V   := hit | ... 
 Det := the | ... 

 In this example, nonterminal symbols denote grammatical categories, like """"sentence"""" (abbreviated by """"S""""), """"noun phrase"""" (""""NP""""), etc., while terminal symbols are English words, like """"John"""", """"ball"""", etc.

 == Pennsylvania is not named after William Penn. == 

 The current version says: ...which Penn named Pennsylvania, meaning """"Penn's woods"""".  
 As far as I know that is not correct, it was named Pennsylvania by King Charles II, against(!) the will of William Penn. 
 Neither being a historian nor expert Wikipedia contributor myself, all I can offer to proof my claim is the Wikipedia article onPennsylvania which states: 

 On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[26] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[27] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[28] owed to William's father, Admiral Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[29] It was called Pennsylvania. William Penn, who wanted it called New Wales or Sylvania, was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[30] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[29] 

 This Wikipedia Article also lists http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts1.html as a source. 

 Many historic books list a letter by William Penn to Robert Turner, written on March 5th, 1681 as a source. http://books.google.at/books?id=RP-IRN8PDnUC&lpg;=PA54&dq;=william%20penn%20robert%20turner%20with%20privileges%2C%20by%20the%20name%20of%20Pennsylvania%2C%20a%20name%20the%20King%20would%20give%20it%20in%20honor%20of%20my%20father.&pg;=PA54#v=onepage&q;&f;=false 

 The letter reads: 
 DEAR FRIEND: My true love in the Lord salutes thee and dear friends that love Lord’s precious truths in those parts. Thine I have, and for my business here, know, that after many writings, watchings, solicitings, and disputes in Council, this day my country was confirmed to me under the great seal of England, with large powers and privileges, by the name of Pennsylvania: a name the King would give it, in honor to my father. I chose New Wales, being as this a pretty healthy country; but Penn being Welch for a head, as Penmanmore in Wales, Penrith in Cumberland, and Penn in Buckinghamshire, the highest land in England, called this Pennsylvania, which is the high or head wood land; for I proposed, when the Secretary a Welchman, refused to have it called New Wales, Sylvania, and they added Penn to it: and though I much opposed it, and went to the King to have it struck out and altered; he said it was passed, and he would take it upon him—nor could twenty guineas move the under Secretary to vary the name; for I feared, lest it should be looked upon as a vanity in me, and not as a respect to my father, who he often mentioned with praise. Thou mayest communicate my grant to Friends, and expect my proposals: it is a clear and just thing; and my God that has given it me, through many difficulties, will, I believe, bless and make it the seed of a nation.

 == Target audience == 

 So, sorry to insult you. I agree with much of what you say about what WP should be. I'm glad you arn't aiming at an educated elite. But 
 * My comment was relevant because much of the argument about spoiler warnings is really an argument about the purpose of WP, and hence about its """"target audience"""". 
 * It is elitist to divide readers of WP into """"target audience"""" and """"other"""". People looking for information about whether to play a game are still looking for information, and should be catered for. Well written articles on WP can do them a service that review sites and amazon can't. 
 * My models for a """"scholarly"""" encyclopedic approach to works of fiction are the massive John Clute encyclopedias of Science Fiction and Fantasy (because I happen to own them). Of course these are much less detailed than WP but their focus is indeed on critical reactions; they highlight innovations but don't obsess on plot: even central works are generally not described in enough detail to spoil the enjoyment if you read them later. Because this sort of info provides a pretty reliable guide to quality, I've read and enjoyed many books years or decades after they were first published which I otherwise wouldn't have bothered with. This kind of serendipity was certainly one of Clute's main aims, and I don't see why it shouldn't be for Wikipedia. 
 * I think it would make an excellent WP article, with full verifiability, if, some time after a game was released, the editor collated major reviews, especially in specialist game mags, and summarised the major comments, along with things like sales figures, awards, etc. Of course this info is available at review sites, but the reader has to do the collation himself, and doesn't get the benefit of WP editors' consensus checking of reliability. Even better would be to describe how later games (& other stuff) was influenced. Obviously this would refer to notable features of the game play. It seems to me this is what WP:WAF is advocating.  
 * You seem to think a """"complete"""" description of the plot is essential. But a plot summary is always a summary... the editor has to decide how much to include. Who benefits from a ton of detail?  Not a prospective player...it's bound to contain spoilers. Not an experienced player...they know it already. Presumably, someone who has no real interest in the game but needs to know this info. I can think of a few examples, but nobody I'd want to spend hours working for free to help. 
 * Bottom line. IMHO an encyclopedia is a tool for providing relevant information. Doing so in a way which satisfies the demands of as many readers as possible is a good. Too much information can actually be off-putting to most readers and serve the interests of a very few. Spoiler warnings at least give visual clues to help skip info unwanted by probably the large majority of readers.

 ==Edit warring is not an option== 
 It seems you ignored my warning above, and continued with your pointless edit war. So you got blocked. This was intended to make you realise that only measured adult discussion can resolve disputes at Wikipedia, but from your resumption of the edit warring today, it seems it hasn't.  I'm going to make a final effort to persuade you.  You see, Wikipedia runs, fundamentally, on consensus.  That's decent, well-meaning people discussing their disagreements and coming to a mature conclusion.  We have, literally, thousands of disputes going on every day, and the overwhelming majority of them are solved amicably and to the benefit of the disputed articles.  Thoughtful discussion on article talk pages is the only way such disputes get settled.  Now it seems the changes you want to make to the Juno (film) article don't enjoy consensus; you've been reverted by a large range of people.  The correct, indeed the only, thing to do is to use your intellect to persuade other editors of the wisdom of your position.  Unfortunately you've chosen to return to simply repeating the changes, again and again and again. And rather than state your case, you've just resorted to threats, saying """"I am going to change it back to the term """"fornication"""", if somesone is going to block me, most of my classmates said they will change it back to the proper term.""""  Sorry, that's just petulant bullying, and we're not going to put up with that. You need to decide now whether to behave decently, to engage in a civilised discussion, or whether to war and bully. The latter path is one of ignorance and failure; you'll just be reverted and blocked and you'll vanish, unwelcome and unmissed, like a fart in a railway carriage.   |  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.625840663909912

"""Well first off, welcome to Wikipedia.  I'm always happy to help someone get started with their editing career.  As for your question, I agree with your mindset and intentions, but I guess I have two questions.  I assume you are asking about the 2009 Women's Professional Soccer season article and not the Women's Professional Soccer article, correct?  If that is the case I would ask where the two articles are that divergent from each other?  If you mean the main WPS article, then I guess I would still agree with your premise, but given the fact that the league is still in its infancy, I don't know how well that would work.  I mean, I agree that every league's article should have roughly the same components: a history section, some information about the clubs that currently comprise the league, some details about the competition, and other notable topics of interest.  The problem is that the sections of the article relating to soccer-specific stadiums, expansion, and rule changes, just for example, were developed by necessity because over MLS's history those have been critical issues for the league.  I don't know if those are necessarily appropriate topics for a WPS article, and that will only be fleshed out over time.  As for the issue of whether it is kosher to just copy the text of an article into another, the answer is absolutely.  I created the 2009 Major League Soccer season article by copying the 2008 article and changing or updating where appropriate.  You don't want to move articles that way, but for creating new articles, especially about recurring things like sports seasons, elections, etc. that is a completely acceptable way of doing things.  Hope that helps, and feel free to ask for anything else you need.    '''''' """,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.519187927246094

"""==NPOV Debate over whether Deckard is Human or a Replicant== 
 Well, first of all, I'll improve my paragraph by putting back its meaning, because somehow you got that by """"nobody tells you"""" that I meant """"sitting with you in the theater"""" rather than """"in the movie"""" and by """"you"""" I mean """"Deckard"""".  So when you changed it to imply that I was saying the audience needs the plot explained to them, it just went from dumb to dumberer.  Having to have the plot explained isn't Dickian; having to be told you're not human is.  I'm mulling whether to use mind-fuck rather than mind-bend, because Phil would have wanted it that way.  Mulling, mind you. 

 And I'm going to remove the idiotic statement in one of the upper sections that """"Deckard"""" is pronouced like """"Descartes.""""  It isn't in the movie, and not even an Austrian with a head cold would rhyme the two.  It's either the dumberest part of the article, or the subtlest troll I've seen in months. 
 

 You're welcome, and thanks for the compliment.  I actually have a very strong opinion on the subject (i.e., it's Ridley Scott's film, not Dick's, not Ford's, not Fancher's, and Scott even changed it to make the issue crystal clear, and the question is much deeper and involves the audience much more using the device of recasting the entire story through a final revelation), but I also believe that NPOV is the soul of wikipedia, so I make sure my side and the other side get the same level of rhetorical emphasis and let the reader decide which makes logical sense.  Your scientific method at work.    

 *Reasons for replicant: 
 -      I think that Deckard being a replicant makes the film MORE interesting, as the audience is led into an emotional relationship with Deckard on the presumption that he's human. To find that he is a replicant, points up the poignancy of the film's core ethical position  the problem established by Frankenstein of the position of artificial sentience in the circle of empathy (per Lanier).  In  terms of the story itself, Decakard's staus as a """"skinjob"""" makes him more orthoganal to the beings  he kills, but it problematises the most important relationship: that with the audience. 
 Hwarwick 
 -     To emphasize Deckard's struggle to find his own identity, and to cause the audience to feel as he does in their own struggle to understand Deckard's identity, and ultimately to question their own understanding of how we can know our own humanity is different, and how we can know anything (cf. epistemology). If the audience does not know the answer until the end, and the characters do not know it either, then the story makes the audience and the characters ask again what is the difference between me and something un-human if I can be either human or un-human and I need someone else to tell me which? This interpretation would also fit the mind-bending quality of a work by Philip K. Dick. Tension in his books often relies on the false paranoia of characters whose identities are being manipulated, impressed on them, or hidden from them. His style is to misdirect the reader—brainwashing the reader as the character is—before allowing the mystery to be solved, sometimes leaving open the identity crisis as well as the philosophical questions of identity and knowability. 

 I agree the information is presented earlier in the article, but I think at the point where the scene is presented as evidence it's important to point out the purposefulness of Scott's director's cut revision.  I'll leave it as-is, and if you agree, you can add it back in.  I'm just going to nudge a typo I noticed.  When I've got some more time (right now I'm kind of procrastinating on something else) I'll read all the stuff you've pasted here and see if there are things that are missing in the article. 
 

 By the end of the movie, he clearly feels empathy for Roy and the other replicants. He has, I think, learned, that the replicants are just as human and just as deserving of life as any """"real"""" human. And, through Deckard, we learn this too. We, too, are challenged by the notion that humanity cannot be assigned, that it is not an inherent trait as much as the label we assign to a very deep, colorful, and complex interplay of thoughts and emotions. And regardless of their origins, the replicants, by virtue of their emotions, needs, and desires, had become just as human as us.  
 If Deckard had been a replicant, much of the movie's relevance to us, the real humans, would have been lost. What would Deckard have learned provided he was an N6? That he too was a """"skin job""""? That he was being used by humans to do the dirty work agains his own kind? That his memories lied to him",0,0,0,0,0,0,1.9185856580734253

 :I'm sure the phrase """"medically unexplained symptoms"""" goes back a lot farther than the '70s...it's an easy enough series of words to put together in a medical setting.  But we can't build an article about a random phrase, so the question becomes:  When was it used to indicate a specific category of illnesses?  I have no idea if Slavney was the first to do so or not, but I think that we're confounding the phrase with an actual category.  A common phrase is probably not notable by Wikipedia standards; a medical category might be if it's in wide use.  So I think we need to identify when this phrase was first coined to refer to a category of illnesses and prove that it's actually noteworthy.  Without an entry in DSM-IV or a similar medical reference, the notability of the concept really needs to be shown.  Also, as someone else said somewhere, if it is considered a medical category somewhere, we need to identify if it's primarily a psychiatric/psychological concept or a broader one.  Similarly, I think we're also confounding the category with related terms like """"somatoform disorder"""" and """"functional somatic symptoms"""".

 == Going away for a little. == 

  

  
 I think I am going to take a break from this place, but only check back with some pages I had involvment with that haven't been deleted. It's discouraging when you go out of your way for long hours seeking the resources and knowing it's valid. But then discover it's been erased by another user or by staff because it doesn't meet their standards, or for some other ridiculous reasons.  

 I mean, I thought the purpose of this place was to encourage others (I must be wrong then, considering how this place is) to contribute their information of what they know. Rather than nick-pick upon their accuracy of their Spelling, English, Grammar and it they are following the rules correctly. Which the rules seems to me pretty up-tight. (Snobbie, with some people seemily giving off the vibe as they have a """"superiority complex"""" issuse.) If this is how Wikipedia continues to run, then I don't see many people wanting to take participate in providing information they may know about the subjects on any of the pages. Which in terms, Wikipedia will then continue to lack resources and have less information than other sources will, and in essence, these other sources will contain more solid facts. That's pretty pathetic to me for a encyclopedia. There won't be anyone that will turn to Wikipedia for resources or facts, and Wikipedia will then become useless. 

 In my opinion, it's great to have excellent skills in something and sure, people make typos and errors, which is fine to change. We're only human and we continue on learning new things. But if you don't know jack-sh*t about the subjects, then maybe it's best to stay out of it and not change the information that people have provided and worked so hard obtaining. This issuse that I am speaking of is only in general, and is not aimed at any particular personnel. I have seen this many times on Wikipedia and just have grown sick of it, and I am a new user.

"""Oh ok, so we're taking consensual sex as non-consensual now. Well I guess if we change around the facts of the case and claim that two women who has consensual sex (agreeing to still have sex despite previously demanding he wear a condom still means it's consensual. Agreeing to keep having sex after being """"woken up"""" having sex means it's consensual) are non-consensual because they, after throwing parties for him and even bragging about the consensual sex they had with Mr. Assange online, decide to WEEKS LATER (whoops, they never claimed rape, only that he be forced to take a HIV test, a denial of his rights) change their mind...then I guess that makes it non-consensual, right? 

 Oh dear, it doesn't. The crime he's wanted for questioning over is by NO definition rape in the English language or English law. The women, even if we were to believe their contradictory claims, repeated recanting, previous admissions to enjoying it, the throwing of the parties and the kissing and telling their friends how great he is, CONSENTED to sex by the definition of consent. By their own admission he didn't force one to have sex without a condom (she demanded a condom and then agreed to sex without a condom, that by itself is consent to have sex without a condom. She could have chose to NOT have sex still, per her demand) and, despite changing her story repeatedly from claims that didn't even mention having sex with her while she was asleep, the other agreed to keep having sex after she was """"woken up with him inside her"""" (which is again NOT rape, even if her claim were believable given her statement changing, she chose to consent to KEEP having sex with him after she was woken up. Sorry, it's NOT rape if you wake up to someone trying to or fucking you and go """"oooh, this is fun, let's keep going""""). 

 Sorry to have to point this out but, just like that idiotic Swedish politician who claims Assange was CHARGED with RAPE (factually refutable statement, he hasn't even been charged), simply claiming it was non-consensual given the evidence presented doesn't magically mean it was rape and that these women didn't have consensual sex.    Sutter Cane 

 And I suggest the user who deleted my comment read the rules. You may not delete users comments just because you do not like them. And next time, before you go spouting off about my """"changes to the biographical article of a living person"""" you should perhaps come up with a better, less far flung, excuse since I DIDN'T EDIT THE ARTICLE. This is a talk page. 

 My comments were regarding the information that has been given in the article and it's sources and clarifying them since the article is pushing POV regarding a very clear cut legal case. They are on topic and have detailed and addressed other users comments (which by your logic would be off topic as well). If the information in the article is incorrect, it is to be discussed and corrected. NOT swept under the carpet because of inconvenience to your POV pushing. It is not rape by any legal definition in the Western world. The sources these users claim reference simply stating """"it's rape"""". As I pointed out, those claims are no different than the Swedish politicians claim of Assange being charged with rape. The factual, legal and evidence based aspects trump the opinion that consensual sex (as occurred with these two women) equates to rape because they decide later they didn't want it. 

 This is relevant to the article and sorry to have to point out but if the facts contradict the claims of """"rape"""" in the article, as per this on topic discussion, they need to be changed. Perhaps you should understand that people discuss the edits before they remove or change things, such as deleting a comment against the rules because you don't like facts being presented. Don't do it again or you will be reported.    Sutter Cane 

 Haha, oh please. Again you've deleted my on topic comment detailing whether this article is accurate. 

 Your EXACT words per your comments on my talk page: """"I noticed that you made an edit to a biography of a living person"""" 

 This isn't an article, this is a talk page. This isn't an article of a living person, this is an article regarding a political and legal authority. FACTUALLY Assange has not been charged with rape, so declaring that consensual sex is rape and he did it defies logic. 

 You WILL BE reported if you delete these on topic comments. No moderator is going to back you since this commentary is on topic, discussing whether the information in the article is accurately worded and your reasons for deleting my comment are a flat out LIE.

 :::""""a minority view among scholars in the field"""" and this is completely relevant how? Given that no one in their right mind argues that some 90% of academics (i.e., """"scholars"""") are strongly left-leaning, you've got a blatant universe of biased observations.

This is just like the case of the sock categories - you make a lot of noise about it, and half of it goes already away by properly looking at it and tagging them properly, another set is just minor as well (the user is tagged on their userpage or, even worse, usertalkpage, so they are well aware that they are suspected or known sockpuppets; or they are aware even of SPI's on them), another set would just find SPI's anyway, so there is nothing extra if you find the categories as well, and then still, most of those editors will never look for it.  And the same is where you command Alan to stop doing something that has already been done for 80%, but because you don't like the way it is done, you command him to stop (the request that you want a better edit summary is reasonable, but it is utterly unreasonable that you request him to stop when he has a good, but not optimal edit summary) - moreover, that results in the second thread about Alan on AN/I where it is blatantly clear that the edits should be done - and have been done for over 80% before.  And so was this.  I am sorry, Fram, but your actions have resulted in a handful of editors walking aweay (if even temporarily), and other being put aside by ArbCom.  And these three examples here just show what futility you have been using against it.  You have in all three cases a point, but your reaction to it is .. way over the top.      
 :Oh, and in case you are thinking to respond - please explain why if you are asked to stop editing (the categorisations) because some editors do not agree with the categorisation scheme, that you can continue (and are still continuing to do that), even though you can not show any other form of consensus for the scheme than 'common practice' (and actually, an RfC is partially condemning what is being done), or why AGK, the arbitrator who protected 7,500 templates at speeds over 100 edits per minute, when he is asked to stop, that he can just continue (note that consensus and policy were against the actions performed by AGK).  But when you ask Alan to stop, he has to stop (even if it influences until then only 4-5 pages) - and he needs to show consensus.  Yes, because it is you, Fram.  And that is what is happening here on Wikipedia - and that is why many long-established, 100k+ editors are walking away or refusing to improve Wikipedia, where those editors don't even wait for you, they just put away their bots and don't operate them anymore.

 == Meaning of North America, sources, questions == 

 I changed the claim of Cabot being """"commonly credited as the first European to discover North America"""" to """"commonly credited as the first European to discover the mainland of North America"""", as that is how the Catholic Encyclopedia puts it. Note the (fairly) common meaning of North America includes Central America and the Caribbean where Columbus made his discoveries in 1492. The North America pages makes this clear, while noting alternate meanings. Of course even this claim is troublesome if Cabot landed on Newfoundland, since that it not the mainland. Still, the mainland statement is sourced, so. Actually the Catholic Encyclopedia takes it further, saying Cabot was """"discoverer of the American mainland""""not just North America. But as the page Americas (terminology) points out, the term """"American"""" is rather vague and problematic. So I left it as North America. Also, there is a paragraph, entirely within parentheses, which I added a """"citation needed"""" tag too:

One half of the globe was for Portugal and the other half for Spain.) 

 I don't doubt the Inter Caetera, but am skeptical that King Francis I of France and King Henry VIII of England were """"in part motivated by the perceived insolence"""" of this papal bull.

 == Q: Why should unpaid volunteers help deal with the flood of non-neutral, non-encyclopedic advocacy that advocates are being paid to overwhelm them with? == 

 The market for shills knows no lower bound in terms of the willingness of organisations to hire poor quality advocates.  On wikipedia I give skills to colleagues who volunteer, on a voluntary basis—this is my main motivation to engage here.  Paid editors who do not comprehend basic elements of scholarly and professional literacy, such as plagiarism, are not only seeking to change the content of the encyclopaedia; they are seeking education from the community.  And I am not willing to volunteer expert skills, skills I have to exert under direction IRL, in order for some wage slave or petits bourgeois contractor to get paid.  I'm happy to help skill up volunteers of the most irreconcileable interests, views and politics.  I'm willing to teach a volunteer why he can cite one music magazine.  I'm willing to teach a volunteer how not to plagiarise by close paraphrase a notable neo-con opinion.  But I volunteer for that very feeling of not working under the direction of management, but along side other free volunteers.   

 I don't maintain an understanding of our reliable sources policy to teach paid shills who can't be bothered reading core policy documents what they should have read themselves.  Nor do I maintain a capacity for spotting plagiarism such that I can teach a paid shill the core of proper attribution and re-expression.  Volunteers get forgiven a multitude of sins, because they come here to give me something I can't give myself: working along side other free people on an encyclopaedia.  Shillery, in particular shills who lack the capacity to author or edit encyclopaedic content, come here to steal my gift and get paid.  Unlike commercialisers of our eventual content, shills intrude on my immediate experience of editing.  And shills have no capacity to claim the collegiality I give freely—they bring nothing collegial to the encyclopaedia.  

 So I am very interested in this FAQ question, and its unanswered status.  I don't believe we should answer it, because I don't believe we should accept the fundamentally non-collegial and unencyclopaedic nature of the shill's """"involvement"""" in our community of encyclopaedists.

 I find it strange that the influence if India via Hinduism and Buddhism (primarily) stretches as far east as Korea but we see very little evidence of if to the west, and the assumption(due to this odd fact) there could never have been any influence on Arabia from India.  

 It was the custom of the Muslim invaders to destroy Hindu Temples across Northern India and build Mosques over the ruins.  This is indisputable, also I believe that Muhammad’s uncle (Abu Talib) is a documented Vedic poet, do you dispute this also? 

 More investigation is needed in the pree-Islamic roots of Arabia to seek the religion before Islam; The Kabba is an ancient Temple (as documented in the Koran).  Its origins are certainly not Islamic and it would be fascinating to find out the true purpose of the Kaaba and the Black Stone within. 

 As a Hindu I’m constantly having to re interpret my Country’s past.

با عرض سلام خدمت رياست جمهوري روسيه .هه نیشخندم  به خاطر خاطراتي هست که در مباحثات قبل از سياست نوين داشتم مباحثات صلح نامه ايران و امريکا زماني که در حال مچ گرفتناي شما واسه رسيدن به قدرت برتر شدن جهان بودم حي چه خاطراتي بود اون موقع خيلي ساده بودم چون تازه وارد پهناي وسيع سياست شده بودم و هنوز به طور کامل از روش هاي سياسي شما و ساير مسئولين دولت ها خبري نداشتم هنوز در مورد ذات تون خوب خبر نداشتم هنوز در مورد اينکه واسه خاطر قدرت مي تونيد دست به چه اعمال غير انساني بزنيد هنوز بي خبر بودم که چه طور با خوب جلوه دادنتون جلوي مردم اونا رو وابسته به خودتون ميکردين که شما رو چون خدايي بدونن که دارين بر انها حکومت ميکنند اين شد که تونستين کمک کم به قدرت برسين و وقتي رسيدين به قدرت شبيه موجوداتي ميشين که بيشتر از اينکه سعي کنيد بر مبناي سه اصل انسانيت و وجدان و حقيقت جويي پيش بريد با پرده پوشي روي اون و روي مردم به خاطر اهداف ظاهريتن مثل قدرت طلبي مثل موقعيت هاي سياسي مثل پيشرفتهايي در نتيجه رقابت هاي ناسالم و با هدف نابودي مردم بازيچه قرار گرفتن مردم و نيز  سو استفاده از عقايد و اعتقادات مردم نسبت به اديان الهي و اعتقاد به خدا نابودي کره زمين و لطمه زدن به ان و نابودي هزاران موجود زنده در نتيجه تخريب محيط زيست به کمک سلاح هاي هسته اي پيشرفته و ايجاد هزاران بيماري که هنوز علم در درمان انها عاجز مانده ممکنه بگيد الان اونقدر علم و تکنولوژي مخصوصا در علم پزشکي پيشرفت کرده الان دلايل هزاران بيماري رو تونستيم کشف کنيم اما چه فايده که در اين چرخه اي که شما مسئولين درست کردين در نتيجه هزاران درگيري که ايجاد شده جون هزاران نفر به خطر افتاده الان که من نوعي دارم با شما صحبت ميکنم ممکنه جون هزاران نفر ديگه يا گرفته شده باشه يا يه خطر افتاده باشه بنابراين اين نشون ميده روش کاري شما و ساير قدرت طلبان با پيشبرد و سرعت بيشتري پيش خواهد رفت تا روش درمان.درمان ممکنه بتونه با کشف يک بيماري طيف وسيعي از افراد رو درمان کنه اما ايا براي مرگ هم درماني وجود داره؟مسلما در خود درمان بيماري ها هم تعداد زيادي از افراد ميميرن و حتي در نتيجه ازمايشات بنابراين درمان در مقابل روش کاري مسئولين که همه و همه کم کردن ها مدافعيت ها و رقابت ها و حتي اتحادهايي که بين چند کشور صورت ميگيره و سياست هاي مرتبط با اون همه و همه واسه خاطر قدرت طلبي و يک هدف مشخص موقعيت سياسي بهتر و طعنه زدن و برتر بودن از لحاظ موقعيت ديني و اعتقاد نسبت به همديگر در حاليکه اين خودش غرورکاذب و ديدگاه برتري بودن هست چرا؟چون اعتقادشون کامل تر هست در حاليکه در درجه اول غرور کاذب که گريبانگير افرادي مثل مسئولين در منطقه خاورميانه شده موجب ايجاد ديوار مرزي و خطي فرضي که روز به روز در نتيجه افکار خودشون بين ادما داره کشيده داره عاملي ميشه که ميزان توجه شان در خصوص داخل اين مرز بيشتر باشه تا خارج از اين مرز مثل اصطلاح اتحاد اسلامي در حالي که اسلام چنين چيزي رو نگفته و اگر پيامبر مدام دم از اتحاد اسلامي ميزد و تمام افکاري در نتيجه اون تنها به داخل اين امت ميشد و مدام دم از ظالم بودن افراد در خارج از اين امت ميزد مسلما ديگه نمي تونست دين رو رواج بده دين اسلام مثل همه ايين ها مال همه انسان هاست دليل بر اين نيست که فرضا من دينم فرق بکنه حق اينو ندارم وارد اين امت بشم حق نداشته باشم حتي در اين دين جست و جو کنم تنها روشي که امت هاي اسلامي ياد گرفتن اينکه اگه در نتيجه يک بارو اشتباه افرادي که در دين اسلامي تحقيق ميکنند يک عملرکدي رو انجام بدن تنها جوابي که مسئولين اون دولت ها به اون دولت مد نظر قرار ميدن اينکه اون افراد يا کافرند يا سو استفاده گر در دين که قصدشون توهين به ايين ماست  در حاليکه اين در نتيجه يک باور اشتباه هست اما فقط کافي هست که البته بگم صد در صد اشتباهاتي مفسران خودشون انجام بدن و در نتيجه اون اشتباه يک بارو غلط رو در بين مردم بندازن با هزاران ترفند که احکام شرعي در نتيجه موقعيت هاي سياسي تغيير ميکنند يا فرضا احکام دين اسلام به دو گروه فرعي و اصلي تقسيم بندي ميشن که اون فرعي ها در نتيجه شرايط سياسي تغيير ميکنند ولي اصلي ها نغيير نميکنند طبق اين بهانه باز عاجز موندن در رفتارشون چرا؟چون تحت تاثير موقعيت هاي سياسي که بهتر بگم بيشتر منافعشون هست و موقعيت هاي سياسيشون در مقياس جهاني خيلي از قوانين اصليشان تغيير ميکنه نمونه بارزش مثل طرح عدم مصرف دخانيات و سپس ازاد سازي دخانيات در نتيجه موقعيت سياسي در حاليکه در هر صورت استفاده از دخانيات براي بدن ضرر دارد جز درواموارد تسکين دهندگي که اونم در نتيجه توليد دارو با دوز کمتر هست در حاليکه با دانستن اين ضرر ديگه مراجع باکل اين قانون رو براي سلامت جامعه شون لغو شده ندانستن اين نميشه رواج دين اسلام بلکه ميشه دوگانگي و چند چهره نشون دادن اسلام در حاليکه خود اسلام يک قانونه و همون قانون به شکل ثابت اما تحت تاثير موقعيت هاي زماني فقط صورتش تغيير ميکنه ولي سيرتش ثابته نکته مهم ديگه اين هست که اونا از دين به عنوان وسيله اي براي پاسخ گويي به مردم جامعه براي ابنکه بي کفايتي خودشونو بپوشونن استفاده ميکنند مثلا در مواردي مثل تحريم ها و بالا رفتن قيمت ها از طرح حرام و حلال بودن در مواد غذايي استفاده ميکنند که پاسخي باشه براي بي کفايتي هاشون در حاليکه هيچ گاه دين نگفته حاکمان براي بي کفايتي هاشون و زماني که در مخمصه افتادن از دين سو استفاده کنند دين حرف از صداقت زده و راستي و طبق اين قانون حاکمان موظف اند که با مردم روراست باشن  نه اينکه بنا به دلايل موقعيت سياسيشون و اينکه جلوي مردم خراب نشن از دين و احکام شرعي سو استفاده کنند يا فرضا به جاي اينکه تاکيدشون سر رسيدگي به موارد ريشه اي باشه و حساس که واقعا حل اون مي تونه بسياري از سو استفاده ها رو از احکام شرعي بگيره در فرضا حل مشکل صيغه و درواقع صيغه هايي که به غلط و بدون در نظر گرفت,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.836256504058838

 == White nationalistm? == 

 I'm a bit confused by the article's description of the WBC as a white nationalist group. Although Phelps has used racial slurs, he seems to have used them more in an attempt to offend the individuals he was insulting rather than as an attack on any racial group. For example, if he's insulting some who is fat, he will call him a """"fat faggot"""" but that doesn't make him anti-fat. Phelps insults anyone who is not sufficiently homophobic and if the person he's attacking happens to be black or fat or whatever, Phelps will use that fact as another weapon at his disposal. I suggest that the allegations of the WBC being white nationalists be removed from the article (although the part about him using racial slurs should stay).  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.8883806467056274

 Thanks for the explanation- Sorry, I am still trying to learn the source codes. Is there a way to send you an article without it going live first? I saw something about a sandbox, but didn't know exactly where that goes. Could I send it to you?  

 What prevents certain groups from planting editors to search and destroy or write slanted articles? Our study (12 airline captains) discovered a report which identified an entirely different group as the 911 masterminds but most of that report was immediately classified. The report is listed in a confusing way and it lacks the meat of the intelligence. I would like to site several passages but its on a pdf- We believe that these passages have been intentionally hidden after 158 pages of fluff and stuff. Any suggestions on how to display the meaty portions first- about 30 pages within a 850 page report? 

 Lastly, its almost comical how KSM came to be the 911 mastermind in the media. We've been following this closely. At the beginning he was the alleged mastermind and after repeating that a thousand times, it just evolved into common knowledge. There's so much wrong with that assertion that we wrote two chapters on it in False Flag 911. In the article on 911 there are assertions that have evolved into convictions by omitting """"alleged."""" How can this be allowed without a trial (or charges) and how can this be corrected?

 == Definition of lithosphere asthenosphere boundary == 

 """"Lithosphere"""" has the potential to become a really great article, but it is currently missing a few key topics. The article would benefit from discussions of the effective elastic thickness and how it relates to lithospheric thickness (Burov and Diament, 1995), rheological models of the lithosphere (i.e., yield strength envelopes)(Goetze and Evans, 1979), and the observation that the equation given for lithospheric thickness does not work for lithosphere older than ~80 Ma, possibly due to small-scale convection (Parsons and McKenzie, 1978). 

 However, I think this article would benefit most from a discussion of the different ways in which the base of the lithosphere is defined. Right now the article suggests that the base of the lithosphere is defined as the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) in olivine, following the mechanical-boundary layer definition of Parsons and McKenzie (1978). However, several other definitions exist including 1) the crust and portion of the mantle which mainly transports heat through conduction rather than convection (i.e., a thermal boundary layer), 2) a rheological boundary defined by compositional differences (e.g., water and/or melt content; this is becoming increasingly well received and should be mentioned), and 3) the seismically fast, elastically anisotropic lid (i.e., seismic lithosphere). An excellent review is given by Fischer et al. (Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 2010). 

 Although the definition currently provided is worth mentioning, statements such as """"the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure"""" reflect the outdated perspective of the article as written.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,7.446723461151123
