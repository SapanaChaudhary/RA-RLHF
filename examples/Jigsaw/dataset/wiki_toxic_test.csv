 So, on the tenth anniversary of 9/11, """"New York Times"""" """"columnist"""" Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack  well, at least since the last time he wrote about it. The headline is, quote, """"The Years of Shame,"""" end quote. And no, it's not directed at radical Islam. Instead, he targets America and the, quote, """"fake heroes."""" Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked. The sick word given that he's not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some 3,000 Americans. No, he's referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes. But the worst part, at the end of this column, the creep writes, """"I'm not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons."""" That obvious reason, he's a coward. I mean, why else would you ban responses? He's like a 10-year-old boy crank-calling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response, hearing his shame for his own wickedness. Now, I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends. But since I'm lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it. But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words: go to hell, Paul Krugman, you bearded, bitter buffoon.""",1

 There are, as I see it, at least four distinct reasons why this is an unusual circumstance that warrants mention: 
 *Miller has been awarded the highest honors possible within his profession, the Vezina and the MVP of the Olympics. Normally when you get profanity used by one player against another, it's from, how shall I say, rather more marginal players. 
 *Miller specifically stuck around till the end of the game to air his grievances to the media, despite suffering a concussion. 
 *It ties into the larger issue of Lucic in particular and then Bruins in general (cf. Chara-Pacioretty) having a reputation for thuggery. 
 *It's rare for such damning words to be spoken to media regarding another player. Normally there's at least a pretense of civility. Miller did preface his harshest words with a qualifier (""""I respected him for how hard he played"""") but then slammed him unequivocally (""""Gutless piece of shit"""").   """,1

 =the Army of Wiki-morons= 

 one is tired of the army of wiki morons. The nature of wikipedia is that, professionals usually refrain from contributing to the area of their expertise. Why? First of all, it would low down their status. A respected expert is not going to “contribute” to a avant-garde “encyclopedia”, for, they have written books and are paid to write. Writing for wiki certainly don't fit their professionalism.  

 But secondly, and most importantly, the motherfucking army of wikipedic morons is there to fight whatever insight or serious info professionals may contribute. These wiki morons, mostly consists of students, slackers, computing geeks... don't have fucking nothing to do everyday, and self-smug with a smattering of knowledge, think themselves as holder of justice et al, with full-fledged fucking wiki-rule this and npov that (and half of them openly have their OpenSource ideology to sell), will blow away or fuck up any expert's contribution in no time, even for subjects that are not controversial. 

 in a sense, this is unavoidable and a weakness of wikipedia, despite wikipedia's tremendous usefulness and the overall trust-worthyness. Wikipedia by itself is a massive of info, of which's utility and general benefit to human animals is far beyond any other commercial and professional encyclopedia out there can be. However, when it comes to deep academic subjects or when depth or seriousness are examed, wikipedia is a laughing stock. 

 I'm writing this for whoever may be reading my talk page. I do so despise the wikipedian fuckheads, though rather nameless.

People in the 1760s did NOT know how smallpox was contracted, other than by association with a person who had it.  In other words, it's highly doubtful that anyone actually believed smallpox could be transferred by way of an inanimate object e.g blankets, tomahawk, piece of meat, a twig,etc. I don't know where this story came from about white people trying to infect Indians with smallpox by blankets, but I've seen quite a few attempts to plant that nonsense into narratives about white and Indian conflicts.

 He is one of the brightest prospects in this world. Currently the 1st round pick in the NBA, however he disguised himself as Andrew Wiggins because he was already too famous in other sports.  Sports like football, American football,  Lacrosse, Baseball and hockey. Many of you know Nathan as a hockey legend, you just didn't know it was him.  He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career. He also had appeared for the St. Louis Blues, that's right he is the walking legend himself Wayne Gretzky. He then realized his true sport, American football. He had been able to find a clone ability and every black footballer known to man kind is Sir Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up.

 == How about Personal Behavior? == 

 I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am frustrated by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   

 I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under """"double standard"""" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of """"double standard""""?  If it is a """"double standard"""" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  """"You are a Hypocrite!"""" apparently does not apply, so, do I say """"You are applying a Double Standard!""""?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   

 To me """"Double Standard"""" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. 

 If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going. 

 This is all My Humble Opinion, and I am probably quite stupid and an idiot.""",1

 While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room: 
 
 Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard 

 Zuck: Just ask. 

 Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS 

 [Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one? 

 Zuck: People just submitted it. 

 Zuck: I don't know why. 

 Zuck: They """"trust me"""" 

 Zuck: Dumb fucks. 

 In another instant message (IM) 

 FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites? 

 ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them 

 ZUCK: probably in the year 

 ZUCK: *ear

 I mean, what the hell happened to this show? It had great ideas, great humor, and outstanding drawing style from Season 1 to about mid-Season 4. Now it just fucking sucks. Season 6 was TERRIBLE! They changed a lot of things about Robot Chicken, including the opening. The new opening is complete crap! Waste of 36 seconds. The writing in this show has gotten blatantly stale (you can tell by the endless repition, or should I say 'feeding' of Predator vs. alien/E.T. Extra Terrestrial sketches). The characters (including parodied characters), sure, they acted like complete dunderheads in Seasons 1-4, but it was enough to actually be funny. Nowadays the characters seem to have the intelligence quotient of a piece of donkey feces, the attention span of a rotten banana, and the thinking pace of expired cow milk. I saw an episode that showed a freaking baby girl sent onto a helicopter that ended up crashing into a frozen mountain! Yeah, very smart, Adult swim.  

 I am utterly disgusted at the shit Robot Chicken has become since the start of season 5  (2011). In the first seasons, you'd get 15 perhaps 20 skits per episode, now we get 10 or less skits per episode. Is that enough evidence Adult Swim has almost completely run out of ideas? 

 Needless to say, the recent episodes of Robot Chicken have been a sheer disapointment and I just hope that they come to their senses and cancel it.  

 It was those douchebags called the Stoopid Buddies that ran this show into the ground! They made the animation look like the episodes could have been done by a 6-year-old, no lie! For god's sake Adult Swim, stop fucking with Robot Chicken! You and your discontent for everyone sickens me just as much as the new Robot Chicken episodes. They're absolute trash! The plotlines are annoying, pointless, and retarded! Seasons 1-4 had perfectly original ideas no true Adult Swim fan could deny.  

 These days, I'd be willing to bet Adult Swim lost atleast 40% of their viewers because of this awful Season 6! And I heard we're supposed to be getting a Season 7 next year, believe me, I hope this is not the case. If is isn't then welcome to another 20 episodes of grief, as I assure Season 7 will be just as mind-meltingly atrocious as Seasons 5 and 6. I am so fucking dissapointed!

I ask how his pathetic day has gone, as if I care. The details are so painfully boring that the whole scene is edited out and suddenly we're in a bar.

Considering I don't drink and his dumb drunk ass can probably barely string a full sentence together, I'm obviously not drinking it. All becomes a blur in his God-smitten head, I just play along. The writer was apparently too unimaginative to layout the scene for the rape, so we're anywhere from a dark alley to his cockroach infested digs. We'll go with the alley. I struggle to get away, using my face only, apparently. I mean, that's normal, right? Yea. So, that doesn't work. Shocker. Then he tears my clothes off; some time passes, during which I can only assume he's waiting for the Viagra to kick in; then he drops his own clothes and inserts his """"bare erect PENIS"""" into my rectum (damn near killed 'em), without lubrication. I can only assume """"penis"""" is in all CAPS as a form of overcompensation; noted. I struggle for a moment, but eventually concede. Probably because I've realized I can barely feel it, so I might as well wait it out... maybe try to push out some poop for shits and giggles... yea, that was a pun.

 ==who are the serbs (aka the vlahs)== 

 1.) Smelly, Vulgar, Usually Unshaven animals native to the southern Mediterranean country of Ex-Yugoslavia. They often think of themselves as being the best but tried to ethnically cleanse a small nation called Bosnia with little success. The world views them as unruly and unwanted much like a dark scar across the face of mankind. They are often viewed as unkempt and largely should be put down. 

 2.) Monsters 

 3.) People who do not deserve to breathe or see the light of day.Bosnians can live in peace and should not carry any resentment because they did not succeed. For as long as one Bosnian in the world has one breath of air in their chest and has one pulse, they will never win. """"Our best revenge will be the laughter of our children"""" =] 

 4.) A beast that I will personally hunt down and slaughter like the animals they are. 

 A Serb will deny that he is a descendent of the Turks. But the truth is that all of them are just rape babies that the Turks left behind during the days of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks rolled through on horse back and fucked any Serbian pussy that they could find. This wasn’t hard because Serbian women like to give up their unshaved and untamed pussies as much as possible. They try to hide their Turkish heritage but if you visit the region of Montenegro you will see just how dark those people are. When I visited Montenegro I didn’t know if I was in Serbia of Istanbul! Turk: Hello Serb: Hello Turk: You look just like me. Serb: I know your great grandfather raped my relatives, but dont tell anyone. Turk: Ok, I wont tell anyone if you let me get with your sister. Oh, what am I saying """"let me"""" Ill just rape that dirty pussy. 

 Word used to describe someone who has serbian herritage, DNA studies show a large portion posess traces of Turkish origin, most likely due to 400 years of ottoman rule and """"intergration"""" over their country. The word Serb/Srb comes from the latin servus or slave. Generally a nation of cretins, cripples, homosexuals, pederacists (pederasy), also known as chetniks, decended from radical peasant slaves with no real sence of honor, dignity and such, hence their wild animal like nature even in todays modern society. There are ofcorse exceptions to every rule and so there is the odd .05% who were perhaps educated overseas who do not fit the profile but are a minority and generally are still infected with radical serb ideology. It is highly unlikely that the serbian race will ever understand that by mongering war in the balkans they are actually disgracing their own kind, this is beyond the majorities intelectual capacity. Bosnian: Ey Drago you faggot, why do you pimp out your own wife? 

 Dragomir (Serb): Its mutually benificial for her and myself. 

 Croat: Only in Servia, only in Servia... o_^

This link is questionable because, among other things, people generally don't smoke with their buttholes after anal sex.",1

 ==African Americans and Colon Cleansing== 

 Colon cleansing is becoming increasingly popular in the African-American Community.  Negro people are the major customers of colon cleansing producers.  Nobody is sure about why blacks are obsessed with the cleanliness of their colons.  Some speculate that it is a superstition brought over from Africa by the slaves.  Perhaps it has something to do with the emancipation proclamation.  Every negro deserves a donkey and a bucket to eliminate in, according to the Articles of Reconstruction.  This lead to the binge and purge mentality of blacks.  In some health food stores, black women are called """"Saturday Night Specials,"""" because they love to come in on Saturday night to get their colon cleansers.  A week of KFC has them plugged up, and they need to eliminate the greasy waste so their shacked up boyfriends can have better anal sex, unless they are planning on having another welfare baby.  Many nutritionists, including Mike Hunt attribute this phenomena to the typical diet of fried chicken, and the increasing price of watermelon.  Economist Raj Sahib says has indicated that watermelon sales in the inner-city have an inverse relationship to prices, and that as watermelon consumption declines, the use of habit forming colon cleansers increases.  Mike Hunt states that Afro-Americans have a higher risk of colon cancer as a direct result of their consumption of mass quantities fried chicken, literally buckets full per household on a daily basis in the typical negro apartment.  Combine this with drinking a forty of Eight-Ball (malt liquor sold by """"the man"""" in our communities to enslave our brothers) on the porch, smokin some menthols, and some chronic, and you have a receipe for disaster.""",1

I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button.

 heres the lyrics 

 [Verse 1] 
 The anatomy of a school shooting, shotgun under my trenchcoat 
 Columbiners did it, dead spoke - bloodred soaked 
 My mind consume the doom as I walk through the school 
 15 people killed and over 14 wounded 
 My name is Eric Harris, I was forever harrased, an outcast 
 You fuck with us and now me and Dylan is pulling out gats 
 I've been wantin to murder people 
 Suicide is played out, if you gonna die, take people with you 
 We've been planning this before the kids from Jonesboro did it 
 And I wanted the world to know when people died why we did it 
 I even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me 
 Feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease 
 Another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you 
 Smalltown killing-spree that's organized by the youth 
 Fuck the media, them fags be disguising the truth 
 Dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news 
 A bunch of ticking timebombs y'all, is more like me 
 Overflowin with hate, bullied to get raw like me 
 They constantly get picked on and shitted on like me 
 You'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me 
 I put my mind to it and what I accomplish's frightening 
 The right thing, no matter what you idiots might think 
 Check it, I did that shit so idiots might think 
 This ain't a game, the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 It's like this, what's more fun than slice wrist? 
 Kill that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kids 
 You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did 
 This is the anatomy of a school shooting 

 [Verse 2] 
 I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil 
 Fuck a favorite I hate everybody equal 
 Bitch I warned y'all, didn't I? 
 Now everybody wanna talk shit and cry asking why 
 - Two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous 
 All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live 
 Two nerdy kids is that a crime? 
 why I've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by 
 - without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked 
 Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit 
 The teachers let it happen 
 I've even seen some of them teachers laughing 
 That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin 
 I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick 
 I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks 
 Don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then 
 - maybe you could've been my friend 

 [Chorus]",1

It is spread throughout the commonwealth countries. English language, democracy, industrial revolution etc... Britain, is not an official multicultural country as Canada is. Neither is New Zealand. South Africa's oppression to balcks and dutch people was horrible yes, but now that South Africa is """"multicultural"""", it has stripped itself of all signs of the British Monarch, has less than  
 15 percent of the population as British etchnicity, and English is a minority language. Canada has made another language official besides English, and has changed its flag to exclude the union jack. Britishness, is NOT AT ALL """"multicultural"""" I'm sorry but that has to be the most stupidest and most incorect statement I've ever heard. That would claim there is no British Etchnicity and British culture is a whore for every single other culture, which is really really not true. Go to Britain, you mean to tell me that is every other culture? no, it is British culture. Australia and New Zealand have some degrees of it, but their """"Britishness"""" is from history of Britain influencing them!

 nah - fuck it and fuck the lot of you. The hypocrisy here runs so deep that I'm can't help but choke on my own vomit as it gurgles up. Further action or comment directed towards me is pointless. I've just finished using a random generator to generate a password that I promptly deleted from the generator so even I won't be able to access this account from now on (just in case I stupidly change my mind again) - if someone has the power to check that I did this, so much the better. Since I never validated an email address on this account, it won't be possible to re-access the account (as far as I know - anyway). It really is unfair and outrageous that hypocrites like you people have basically get away with actions that are far worse than anything I've done in the past week or so but I am blocked for what is essentially a content dispute. I have reviewed most of my recent contributions and I honestly can't find any example of anything that is excessively uncivil with a couple of exceptions which I quickly recanted by strikethrough or reverted. Sysops such as AMIB and others, feel they can violate the POLICIES at will and the issue me a MONTH LONG BLOCK where there isn't even cause for it stated in the blocking policy! I am the first to admit that the personal attacks I engaged in SIX MONTHS ago required some punitive action, but I can't frankly see that I've been uncivil to anyone in any excessive manner (certainly no more so than I've been treated), and I really think that hypocrisy here speaks for itself. When I mentioned your past history, Aaron, it wasn't a fucking attack, it was pointing out A FACT. You engaged in a serious disruptive and childish act of vandalism (by your own admission), simply because you were pissed off at another editor - did you get blocked at all? NO. I point out that other editors who happen to be admins have come extremely close to personal attacks by calling people with obviously legitimate opinions as """"non-rational"""" and """"religious"""" and THAT GETS A BLOCK?  Get serious. The inconsistency is galling. To be met with charges that I've never contributed anything to WP is just an added insult that shows the clear partisanship of those involved.  Not only did I frequently edit articles outside of schools in the past, I even created some articles that have no relationship whatsoever to schools. It's insulting and yet another example of the HYPOCRISY around here to personally attack someone who has created legitimate, encyclopedic articles and improved others as someone who doesn't contribute anything except acrimony. It doesn't really matter what you all decide to do with this account, I won't be able to access it after this rant. I know that getting me to leave the project is the point of some of these actions, but I so far past caring that I'm surely not going to carry on trying to defend myself to hypocrites such as yourselves.""",1

Their connections with the state of Israel are extensive."""" Can anyone prove this? Sounds like speculation with anti-semitic undertones. 

 ==Sources?== 

 This article contains a lot of allegations concerning ethnic/religious backgrounds and very few sources to back up the claims.  
 What is the source of the obscure """"estimate"""" that the Russian Mafia put $4 billion dollars into the Israeli economy? 
 And how is """"Jewish predominance"""" within the Russian Mafia defined? It would be better to mark these passages as speculations since these claims can obviously not be substantiated. 

 The whole of idea of Jews in organized crime is preposterous and ludicrous. There is no such thing. I should know. Meyer Lansky, Miami, Florida. 

 == Anti-Semitism? == 

 I agree that this article needs reviewing, but to claim that it is anti-semitic is jumping the gun. 

 To claim that there are no Jews in organised crime is also ludicrous. Are we to believe, that of the whole Russian Mafia organisation, there is not one single Russian Jew involved?  

 For you to request sources from the writer of this article, and then claim that there are no Jews in organised crime without any evidence whatsoever is hypocritical at best. 

 Maybe you should look past the end of your nose at the bigger picture before making such serious accusations.

 hi, i found the article about you using the random article button. i noticed when i was reading it that it seemed too long and so i went to the talk page to see if there was a reason. i noticed that some editors had made really uncivil comments, and i decided to stick around to convince you that the wikipedia system is not against you, nor do all wikipedians do that sort of thing. i request that you ignore what the other editors said about your, um, sanity (not to imply that you'd be interested in pursuing such pettiness of course!). 

 as for the article itself, i think it is definitely too long. i suggest offhand deleting the entire early life section or summarizing it like """"you always were fascinated with physical and social science"""" and not distracting the focus from what you've done to deserve an encyclopedia article. don't worry, you're a published author, what you did way back when will not be lost just because it's not included on wikipedia. in any event, removing the early life section will give them a lot less pretext to make stupid comments and will probably make the cleanup crew really happy.

 I know some of you don't see the other side of the size community because you don't participate in it. You participate in your own little corner of that. 
 Being a female macrophile who is pansexual, I find myself in many of the communities, GTS, gay GT sites, and of course F/f and M/f (SW related) websites. There are thousands, hundreds of thousands of us. I know, I sell to them. 
 I'm an artist, I run a macrophile meetup group in NYC. I know we are a big group, and just like GTS fans are oblivious to the M/f SW groups, they are also equally ignorant to the numbers. 

 Yes, I'm well aware there are more GTS fans than SW fans or GT fans, but that doesn't mean we don't exist or that there are only a few of us. 
 The rest of us have partners too, people who go and google this shit. AND YOU'RE GIVING THE WRONG IDEA.  

 If you guys keep reverting the language, I swear I will spread the word about this shit. I got 10,000 followers combined on my DA, Tumblr, FA and Ekas. I can get the word out fast.

 I eventually want to write various articles, the first of which will be about porn star Mazy Kyst.   
 I am very open to critiques. 
       

  Mazy Kyst is a former pro-am XXX fetish star and model. She is about 40, an amazonian 5'10"""" with monster 44GG breasts; a born bisexual and exhibitionist. She calls herself a slut-goddess, a submissiveve, masochistic woman who loves gang-bangs, tight bondage, spankings, and fetish clothes.   

 """"I am the whorax, and I speak for the sluts"""" Mazy Kyst 

 Filmography: 

 ODYSSEY ON THE EDGE   Mazy is forced to serve as a dinner table, steak & potatoes are eaten- cut right on her chest and breasts. Then, her pussy is shaved, and vibrated to a noisy orgasm. She is cut, and her Master drinks her blood!  Then, Mazy is flogged in bondage, with closeups of her luscious breasts being pierced by needles. With Master Vicious. 

 MULTIPLE MAZY  Flogging of Mazy; biting fondling DP vibrating writhing orgasms sobbing bondage screams, oh my!   

 CHAINED CAPTIVE  Delicate Mazy is chained helplessly with her arms overhead, while being flogged, her mouth is duct taped, she's held down and her breasts are pierced with needles. Some blood, intense.  

 DINNER PARTY  Dinner eaten off of Mazy! Some edge and wax play  

 DUTY CALLS Mazy orally services Master Vicious in her skimpy outfit, hot sex naturally ensues.  

 OO LA LA OW! Mazy dresses like a red and black can-can dancer, before being bent over and flogged 

 SHAVE AND A TWAT SHOT Mazy's crotch is shaved, and the Master  Vicious carves his initials into her leg.  She has a spectacular orgasm

 Yeah that's right. You filthy worthless fucking shill. You are what is wrong with the world. You are the person who will lie, who will aid in the misinformation of millions, for a buck. Whatever they are paying you, I'm sure it's not much, people like you are cheap. I curse you, Yellow up. Certainly I curse Babylon and their bullshit invasive malware, but first and foremost I cure YOU. You are a single person who has dedicated themselves to aiding and propagating Babylon's cancer. I'm singling you out. May you suffer the accumulated cost and stress incurred by your master's malware. One day, when you have truly been stung by something that was not as it seemed, when you are stressed out of your mind and truly personally fucked- may you raise no fist to the air, for this is but a fraction of what you deserse. You snivelling evil little piece of shit. You are an embarrassment. An embarrassment to the human race, and common decency, and an embarrassment to your family. Go on, call your mother right now and ask her if she is proud of what you do? Ask her if she is happy the child she raised now spreads lies for a harmful company for pathetically small sums of money. She doesn't know, of course, because you haven't told her. You are ashamed of yourself and you fucking well should be. You, and the company who whores you out, are a stain on the brilliant face of israeli entrepreneurship- you will never stand proudly in a country so rich in honest and competitive entrepreneurs. You are the scum of Israel, and you are the scum of the internet. 

 Deep inside of all of us there is a child. A child that once dreamed of doing great things, being a good person, and improving the world. You have failed that inner child, Yellow up. You commit yourself to pathetic shameful work, are a bad person, and help to make the world a worse place by making it more difficult for other people. I would appeal to you to change your ways, to make up for this bullshit by maybe doing something to help others- but people like you never change. Truly. It sounds crazy, but without a doubt it is dishonest people who are the most reviled, unpopular, lonely figures. Think about it, people can be vain, violent, ugly, rude, timid, drunk, arrogant, or hysterical, and still have friends who overlook their flaws. Liars? Nobody is truly friends with someone they know to be a liar. They are social scum, tolerated at best, spoken ill of when not present. The romantic partners of liars grow to resent them, often leaving. The dishonest grow old lonely, resented by any family that still tolerates them, avoided by everyone else who can. They never change, either. You are one of these people, Yellow up. A peddler in untruth.  

 When you delete this, just as your finger hits the 'delete' button, I want you to realise it is because you are deeply ashamed of yourself. That a part of your dishonest piece of shit little self doesn't want people to know what you are. Taste that realisation and savour it. Also note that I haven't wished you death; it's not a nice thing to do. If you truly come to comprehend how revolting of a person you really are (and I doubt it), don't kill yourself. The least you owe the world is to compensate and do something to improve it, try to make this place better for a change.  

 I hope you spill coffee all over your nice shirt. Next time you spill shit on your shirt, think of me, and this, and what a deceitful little shit you are.",1

 it started with the infamous story:  

 Today being Halloween, I decided to fuck with the major retard at school when I came out of science for break. He was dressed as Ash. Knowing this was going to happen, I brough a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me. 

 """"So I heard you like Mudkips..."""" """"Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUUVE MUDKIPS."""" """"O RLY? So, would you ever fuck a Mudkips, that is.."""" (he cuts me off before I could said 'if you were a mudkips') """"OF COURSE."""" """"Well I just happen to have a Mudkips here, and."""" 

 Before I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his pants were down and he was violenly humping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips I started to walk away, because there is no way I'd be caught wrestling a half-naked crazy guy humping a Mudkips. 

 Needles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn't want to be involved. 

 I came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still fucking it and baying this real fucked up 'EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF' sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid. 

 I asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to pummel the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were freaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation. 

 A few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classrooms. Over the intercom the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Uh.. what the hell. 

 So we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. This time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling """"I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I'M GONNA SUE..."""" and it was cut off. 

 I asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and 'whatever else happened.' The school threatened to counter-sue because of lewd conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight. 

 So I ask you: do you like Mudkips?   """,1

 Being that Wikipedia (or one of Wikipedia's """"Trolls"""" or high and holy """"Police"""")recently falsely accused me of """"Vandalism"""" and Personal Attack"""" even though I did no such thing.  I have decided to legitimately launch an attack on en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_(cat)  a Wikipedia entry known as """"Nora (cat)"""": The Piano Playing Cat. 

 I find it highly inappropriate that """"Nora"""" has a Wiki Page in light that Wiki is known to allow on-line terrorism to be launched against innocent persons' Wiki Pages, and in fact allow pages to be Deleted on flimsy grounds of """"Fails To Meet Notability"""" standards. 

 I don't care if """"Nora"""" has perhaps more youtube.com views than some talented humans. 

 Fact: Nora is a cat, and not EVEN a pure breed. 

 Fact: Nora is a novelty creation of her Humans. 

 Fact: Nora is """"spam"""" to direct clicks on her Human's on-line store link. 

 Fact: Nora's story in the London Times isn't cited with a proper link to that web-page. 

 Fact: The shelter Nora was adopted from is not cited. 

 Fact: The scientific journal that Nora is supposedly mentioned in is NOT cited. 

 Fact: The video at the symposium is not linked nor was it properly cited, and it was apparently a one time showing that can not be proved, nor is there a link to that video in any archive. 

 Fact: Nora was mostly a media created pseudo oddity that was viewed primarily early in 2007 here> www.youtube.com/watch 

 Fact: Nora is of Wicca cult religion and is evil. 

 Fact: Nora gets outside and kills birds, therefore harming the balance of the ecosystem. 

 Fact: Nora hardly uses her left paw at all on the piano this puts her in a subclass of Wikipedia want-to-be idiots that make their downs syndrome child play """"Chopsticks"""" on the friggin' piano.

 Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big 
 Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy 
 I embrace y'all with napalm 
 Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone 
 How could Nas be garbage? 
 Semi-autos at your cartilage 
 Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne

 When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep 
 That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef 
 Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo 
 To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle 
 This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid

 What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother

 And now I smile like a proud dad, watching his only son that made it 
 You seem to be only concerned with dissing women 
 Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly? 
 Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me 
 Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly 
 In '88 you was getting chased through your building 
 Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers 
 All I did was gave you a style for you to run with 
 Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god 
 Wearing Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars 
 No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case 
 Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase

 SNAFU 
 Take a good look, Bud!   
 You're looking at a trio of chicks 
 who've been through the mill! 
 We've been to London, North Africa,  
 we've flown on a plane 
 all over Brazil! 
 We learned an awful lot from all you fellas (I'll say!), 
 but there was just one thing no one would tell us.... 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 What's it all about? 
 Can't figure it out!  
 Is it contagious? Or simply outrageous? 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it like a pill? Or is it a thrill?  
 Is it a military secret? 
 We asked a looey* who at first was rather formal, 
 and then he laughed and shouted """"Situation normal!"""" 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU Means! 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 Is it something new that officers do? 
 Is it a dropkick?**  Or only a topkick?*** 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it cold or hot? Inspected or not? 
 Is it a pot**** - of GI coffee? 
 We wrote a congressman for further information. 
 He said, “You'll have to start your own investigation!” 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Now, fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU means! 

 Bud = Any guy (you could substitute “Pal” or “Friend” or “Joe”). 
 Chicks = Girls, women. 
 To go through the mill = To gain experience (usually not in a good way). 
 To spill the beans = To reveal a secret (sometimes accidentally). 
 Inspected or not? = I think this is a naughty reference to military VD (“short arm”) inspections. (VD = STD) 
 *looey = lieutenant 
 **dropkick = a move in football (but here I suspect it’s something else, maybe naughty) 
 ***topkick = sergeant 
 ****pot = toilet (probably) 
 GI = Government Issue = soldier(s’) 

 SNAFU, BTW, means """"Situation Normal, All Fucked Up!"""" 
 Its counterparts are TARFU (""""Things Are Really Fucked Up!"""") 
 and FUBAR (""""Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition!"""") 
 All of the above are WWII slang.

 I was not happy with how PAL deal with the zero viisibility problem! I am one of the passengers who's flight was diverted to Clark. We were stuck on the plane for 7hours! No food,no water,no information,toilet stinks,FA not attending to us,plane was so hot and we are sweating to death...they did not treat us like human out there! We are there you diverted the flight for our safety but PAL you did not treat the passengers well enough to let your flight attendants or the pilot tell us what is going on! Upto this time I am not over with my anger on how we were treated! Having a low airfare and lost your whole day of business is not worth! And most esp when you are travelling with kids! There were a lot of people who have connecting flights but ofcourse if you are taking PAL for connection they will delay to get you on the flight! I cannot compose myself with such a HOrrible experience! I have always been die hard filipino! but PAL SUCKS! I hope they will do better...recall all the passengers and maybe compensate us with what you ruined! You could have let us out so we can take another flight to our destination! but instead we felt like we were on a Plane Hostage for 7 hours People! not right! I am just shaking with anger as I am typing every word!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were on a plane arrest for 7 hours with Philippine Airline kids running around not having food! Some of us did not have breakfast not enough sleep since we are taking the early flight! Not a single drop of grain has been offered to us! PAL you are the vehicle to our home-country the Philippines so give us shame esp to the freign people who are visiting! Well how damn if you can't even take care of your own fellow filipinos on flight! SUCKS!",1

 You need to stop reverting valid edits on this article.  

 *If someone edits in some new info, you have come along and re-worded it because you didn't like the way it was originally typed. 
 : ie The plot that was recently added. 
 *Which brings me to editing a plot synopsis, it's stupid. It has come from the production company and is usually the text printed on the back of the DVD. No one cares if you don't like the way it's set out. 
 *You edit text that others have added so the original meaning is lost 
 :When I added the info about the DVD/BD release date, I originally had it set out to say to to say that the """"DVD and the first Bluray in the series history would be release on...."""" but you changed it to """"For the first time in the series history, the episode will be released simultaneously on DVD and Blu-ray"""" which implies that there has been previous BD releases, but wasn't released the same time as the DVD. 
 * You make up rules to justify your edits/reversions.  
 : Retailers are valid sources for DVD/BD release dates, they get the information from the distributor who gets it's from the production company. Using your logic, any DVD that is not confirmed in a press release (since you also regard fan-sites as invalid) is not allowed to be mentioned on Wikipedia until the DVD has actually been released. They are accepted across many other TV show articles. 
 : You've named Twitter an unreliable source. Even if the Tweets that are being used as a reference are coming from accounts that are confirmed to be Seth MacFarlane or Kara Vallows. Information from these tweets may not have a """"proper"""" source for many, many months resulting in missing information that could have been present. Again, tweets are accepted on other articles given the account is confirmed.

 :Pehalps I'm too close to be objective, but I removed a statement in the lead about the old IRA and the 1920 partition as being irrelevant to the Manchester bombing. I would prefer a more recent analysis in the lead; that it was an attempt to derail the then peace process -  which as sought to resolve the age old . It was a politically motivated, not historically minded bombing. The 1974 thing set off alarm bells (not biombs dont worry!) but the rest of the article is written in a journalistic style, outside context, so thats fine as regards accruacy. There is a bigger pic regards political motive though that I think is missed. Maybe a political impact, or political aftermat sect.    
 ::Your 75,000 or so students made me laugh, I'm think it would raise a dry warmth in the black heart of Salfords own MES.    
 :::Also, there was a power struggle within the leadership of the IRA at the time, and thoes who sanctioned the bombing were basically against the direction Sinn Fein were taking the Republican movement. Openion went against them, but the same leadership lead to the Omagh bombing. With that in  mind I wouldn't bother with the early 1920s.    

 :::How can you explain the IRA's efforts at reunification without at least a passing mention of the partition that made reunification their goal? Do you have any reliable sources that claim the bombing was an attempt to derail the peace process? I admit that's the conclusion any rational adult looking at the evidence would probably come to, particularly as the GMP investigation report wasn't forwarded on to the CPS, and the police got so annoyed when it was leaked to the Manchester Evening News. There's clearly no doubt that there were a whole lot of political shennanigans going on, but what more can be said about them in the article than is already said, without drifting into OR territory?

 [Verse 1] 
 Now I'm a tell you off top shit gone get a little drastic 
 Frayser come around its a wrap like plastic 
 Never punked out or pushed around like a basket 
 Keep yo lips zipped or you'll be next wit yo ass kick 
 Make it stick and move in and out like mash it 
 Handle that get the check, hit the bank, cash it 
 Niggas talking shit don't you get you ass blasted 
 Fuckin wit the bay could be deadly like acid 
 Laws come around them I'm poof like magic 
 Gone in 60 seconds now I'm breathing like a addict 
 Keep a tone close just in case I got some static 
 Nigga in the north ended up kinda tragic 
 Ridin home drunk in the car bout to crash it 
 Them folks took my license now I'm parked like Jurassic 
 Sittin [?] out so you know a nigga had it 
 Pick her up hit the room bang got her matted 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 If you got a closed mouth then you don't get fed 
 If you don't ask for chewin then you don't get head 
 You a real gangsta nigga then you don't get scared 
 Off you ass young nigga or you don't get bread 

 I wake up to a blunt got to sleep a blunt 
 Keep a tone in the car in the house is the pump 
 Bitch niggas get stomped it's the pumpkin head month 
 That got me looking for you like a Easter egg hunt 
 Got no love for you chumps real niggas don't front 
 Gotcha mug on me fellin Froggy then jump 
 Don't end up in the trunk cause you heard a lotta funk 
 Frayser boy bring the pain like [?] 
 Need an entourage every fuckin where you go 
 Cause you no when you alone you a flat foot 
 Hoe pop pop da trunk hit the pump I'm headed on a fuckin mission 
 Time to ride lets go hide devour all my competition 
 Im bout to handle that im, bout to get the gat 
 Broke down on you once nigga you remember 
 That been drankin all night been smoking all day 
 So when you when you so fuck up my nigga this is kinda [?] 

 [Chorus] 

 [Verse 3] 
 I been doin this since Moby dick was a gold fish ho 
 Time a let her hold somthin bitch hold this 
 In her hand is a fat dick she stuck like a magnet 
 You already knew the answer hoe before you ask it 
 Break a hoe to the flow use the pimp tactic 
 Tricken all the time got you blind like a bat bitch 
 Money getting slim so its time to black mask it 
 I know this dumb nigga keep his do in the mattress 
 Appreciate things acting like I never had shit 
 Fetty getting short make the stretch like elastic 
 Take a couple hits off the blunt then pass it 
 Smoke so much green niggas call me Saint Patrick 
 On the phone wit this hoe she say that she a bad bitch 
 My nigga hooked me up I never seen her but I'm matted 
 Pullin up I got her mind blown like a gasket 
 A ten on the phone but when you see her she a fat bitch

It should not have been determined by the wider membership a vast of majority of whom are not even in elected office. 

 Second of all he decided to take on the leadership so soon after the party's 1997 defeat. Politically it would have been wise for him to have let the more experienced Ken Clarke become leader and waited things out. If he had waited then he and not David Cameron would be leader now.

 == F**k! == 

 Thought I'd get some opinions here..  The word """"fuck"""" has been reverted several times to """"f-word,"""" """"f**k,"""" etc.. and reverted back again.  It seems to me that there's no reason to include the word in an article about a movie geared towards children and teens.  There have also been a few Mormon users on this site who have found it offensive.  Being a movie made entirely by Mormons, I would expect that there would be a lot of Mormons reading the article that would be offended as well.  Is it really necessary to keep reverting it to """"fuck""""?  I'm not offended by the word, and I'm sure many others are not... But we all know what """"f**k"""" means, and we all know what """"f-word"""" means, so what value does actually putting the whole word in the article add?  Furthermore, it has always been """"wikified"""" so if anyone is indeed confused (unlikely), all they need to do is click on the word and they're taken to the article in all its glory.  Again, my opinion is that when we're talking about a children's film, especially one that never included the word to begin with, it's in bad taste to put swear words in.

 == Homosexuality? == 

 The opening paragraph reveals that Jackass #2 is comprised of """"Stunts, Gags and Skits,"""" this is what I would label the first Jackass Movie. 

 I, personally, could not even stand watching this film as most of the """"skits"""" contained blatantly homosexual material. Normally, a gag would open with """"I'm Johny Knoxville, and I'm gonna..."""" normally something extremely funny such as """"...light a cherry bomb in an old folks home, punch wee-man in the face with a hydraulic ram"""" is followed. Jackass Number Two, in contrast to all other Jackass films, opened with """"I'm Johny Knoxville, and I'm gonna film wee man nude, do a shit on camera, fly a kite using anal beads shoved up my ass, ram a dildo up my ass on high speed using a 50kg weight"""" I would not EVER consider this a proper Jackass movie: blood and stupidity has been replaced with """"putting a crocheted mouse on my penis and filming it"""" (This really happened!!!) 

 PS: I only watched about 10 minutes worth of REAL material on this film. After the opening line had become gay, I'd skipped to the next chapter; later came to the realization that Live Male-Male Dildoing was regularly featured i was disgusted!

9b1734aab5f3a10c,"Hello friends and readers of this hot story site I am Rohit from Jammu writing for the first time for story submission of my lust for didi s bust.  
 I am 23 and my sister is jsut elder to me by two years. She has completed her degrees from Delhi where as I have studied in Jammu. Whenever during summer vacations when my sister use to come to Jammu for stay she use to accompanied by any of her friend.for onward travel to Srinagar. This time when she came she was accompanied by Veena from Delhi. My Mother use to accompany her to Srinagar but this time my mother was ailing hence my name was proposed to accompany them. I was surprised to carry two soft ladies to Srinagar but the family decision was on higher side so we left for Srinagar on Sunday itself reaching there by same night. We hired a double bedroom in Shastri Chowk area and settled down for night there with a will to start the touring from Monday till saturday this week. 

 My didi who was 25 with nice 34 24 36 body line. I have every lust to c the cleavage of my didi whenever she is at home and I have many a times tried to touch her boobs also. The reply was a simple smile from her side. With no further action we always finished here. This time didi was with Veena the another bitch from delhi she was around 24 and heavy bustline may be 38 28 38 . We have hired one double so while sleeping in night the system was sister will sleeping mid of we two. Veena and me. I got much opportunity to touch the didi boobs and ever touch my ever erosing dick at the back gate of Didi during the night.  
 I was keeping hand on didi while sleeping some time it touched her boobs and my dick hitted her ass area duiring the night. The first night was over I saw didi was smiling at my acts.We get prepared and had breakfast and we were out for sightseeing within an hours times.We went to Nishat bagh Salamar garden Nehru Garden and the day was over> we came back in the room and had our evening tea and started chatting. We touched every topic till last. it comes to friendship of boys and girls. Bothe bitches enquired about my girls friend. I jokingly said that My sister is only my girlfriend. Hearing this my sister smiled and said are you still virgin. I said Yes but replied with this question Are You. 

 She smiled and said if you are virgin and I am your girl friend then I am too virgin. At this I got up from my seat and hugged my sister tightly and kissed her deeply. She resiprocated and smiled gently. I asked about Veena. Veena smiled and saidwe are studying there no doing all this things.i felt sorry for myself and we planned for dinner. bcoz in Srinagar it is too early for night and night life is almost dull. So we had dinner and went to bed for having deep sleep but my mind was upsent today thinking about myself and my sister who was lying near me. I kept my hand over her and she took my hand and pressed it deeply against her boobs. I was becpoming hot and was feeling erection in my dick but the presence of Veena was making another problem for both of us. 

 My sister took my hand and kept it on the boob of Veena to see her reaction.She didnot reacted to it and simply took away my hand from her boob. My sister turned towards me and said ” Are you hungry”. I said mauka bhi hain aur dastoor bhi hain. baki jaisa tum chaho. she said I am ready but what about Veena should we involved Veena in our game plan. I said Yes.  
 She turned to Veena and told her to come in between us. So that we all three should enjoy nthe game.She agreed and came in between us and I started pressing her boobsover the shirt. 

 She was in shirt and Salwar where as My didi was in nightgown I simply lifted the shirt of Veena and My sister unhooked her bra and she was lying naked from top in between us.Veena insisted we both should took off our clothes too so I took off my shirt too and my sister took off her night gown and I ttok off the salwar of Veena. So we all three were in naked position lying on the bed in night lamp. we were taking look of each others assets and were in smiling mood. Now I shifted my position and was lying in between both the biches and rubbing cunts off both my sister and veena. both were getting wet and both were holding my erected dick> My didi insisted that I should fuck her first as it is her right first. But Veena was insisting I may enter my dick first in didi but she should be fucked first……. to be continued…..",1

 ::::::I see this is an OLD comment thread, but in case anyone is still contemplating this, I wanted to talk about it. I don't think it's a racist term at all.  What you have to realize is that the words aren't really linked to each other.  White trash means someone is white, and they are trash.  Black trash would mean someone was black, and trash.  I can understand objecting to something ridiculous, like n****r trash, but that's only because the descriptive word is racist. White is not racist.  Black is not racist. White trash is not racist.  Racism implies superiority of one race over another. I surely don't think """"white trash"""" implies all whites are trash.  It'd be like if """"Chinese jerk"""" were a term - no, it does not imply """"Chinese people are jerks,"""" just that the particular person it is directed at is Chinese, and a jerk. Secondly, does it matter to the article?  Is there a section saying it's racist, or do you want to add one?  If the first, I'd say let it go, and if the latter, I disagree on the basis of the above points.  Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  Thanks!

 While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room: 
 
 Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard 

 Zuck: Just ask. 

 Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS 

 [Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one? 

 Zuck: People just submitted it. 

 Zuck: I don't know why. 

 Zuck: They """"trust me"""" 

 Zuck: Dumb fucks. 

 In another instant message (IM) 

 FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites? 

 ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them 

 ZUCK: probably in the year 

 ZUCK: *ear

 If some experiments may suggest it all right, it must rather refer to something else than SPEED - it can be gravity or whatever... 
 Because there can't be any such ABSOLUTE difference in time measurements (in this case pertaining to SPEED)  because, as the same exact science states that there's no evidence of any ABSOLUTE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE (hence the ULTIMATE FRAME for all speed measurements), there CAN'T EXIST a SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS insisting that a certain absolute determination depends on such RELATIONAL rubbish as SPEED.

 BLAAAM!!! 
 (feat. Anybody Killa) 
 [Anybody Killa]  
 Story time, bitch!  
 All across the East Side  
 [Violent J]  
 What? I represent Delray!  
 [Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 Delray!  
 [Anybody Killa]  
 So?  
 [Violent J]  
 South West Side!  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 This Gypsy aunt of mine  
 You're the lucky one  
 She died and left behind  
 An ancient piece of time  
 I didn't know what it was  

 You're the lucky one  
 Knuckle deep in dust  
 Edges played with rust  
 I started to get pissed  
 You're the lucky one  
 This lamp is all I get  
 A worthless piece of shit  
 But once I rubbed it clean  
 You're the lucky one  
 A genie popped on the scene  
 Brought true my every dream  
 [Chorus]  
 I was like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I was like  
 BLAAAM! Sharp axe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Hot tracks  
 Everything I need  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 Now I'm in a fizzle  
 You're the lucky wizzle  
 Hotties on the wizzle  
 Still a juggalizzle  
 I drive a platinum car  
 You're the lucky one  
 It has a tennis court and a bar  
 You know who I are  
 Money out the ass  
 You're the lucky one  
 I'm wishing while it last  
 Genie's moving fast  
 [Chorus]  
 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Free bank  
 BLAAAM! Necks cut  
 BLAAAM! My shank  
 Anything I want  
 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Hot wings  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Big thangs  
 Everything I need  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 Now I am a king  
 You're the lucky one  
 I have everything  
 Nothing's challenging  
 Nothing makes me proud  
 You're the lucky one  
 I stand out in the crowd  
 While others beg out loud  
 I remember when  
 You're the lucky one  
 Money was so thin  
 But dreams were all up in  
 Looking at my lamp  
 You're the lucky one  
 Would I give it all back?  
 Shit, fool, give me that  
 [Chorus]  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Bitch slaps  
 BLAAAM! Cheap wine  
 BLAAAM! Dub H (waffle house)  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Half pipe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Moonlight  
 Everything I need  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Sharp axe

 The moral of the story is  
 BLAAAM!  
 Those who never had shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 And then get shit  
 WHAT?  
 Need to get shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 So if you got shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 Or you need shit  
 BLAAAM!  
 Get some shit  
 GO GET YOUR SHIT

The guy who spends all his money on a better computer and multiple anime figures to litter his walls and shelves).

 I do not come here to AIM or MSN or otherwise 'chat' with you.

 Fucking normals. 

  

 No, seriously, what's with the influx of normals recently? Everything was nice and good a few months ago, but since about 6 months ago the school has gone straight to shit. Not even """"afterschool Crooms"""" is safe now.  
 
 Are we getting invaded? I don't want to believe that Crooms has fallen this low. The people in this class and many others look like something out of fucking Seminole. 
 
 I'm actually convinced 95% of the people in this class are some clique trying to troll us. It's fucking impossible that there are so many normals actively conversing in this class. It's insane. 
 You waltz in, completely disregard the established school culture, do whatever the fuck you want, call whomever you disagree with """"gay,"""" and you say you are not being selfish? Just kill yourself. The human race can do without people like you. 
 

 I actually worried about this school’s quality. Have you been to any afterschool clubs recently? How about that Gamer’s Club? They are nothing but Facebook-tier normals. Can you imagine what would happen if those people get used to this school? 
 I mean, normals have always been here, but the thing now is that no one says anything. 
 Dozens of conversations are filled with: 
 >""""my friends"""" 
 >emoticon users 
 >""""why are you so mean?"""" 
 >""""gosh, stop trying to fit in"""" 
 >exclamation marks  
 >""""dude, you should get out more"""" 
 >""""so I and my friend"""" 
 >""""this is no sad c"""" 
 >""""lol yeah"""" 
 >""""did you see the new update on facebook? i'm so fucking hype!!!"""" 
 
 And so on. It's sickening 

 

 well, well, well, what have we here another faggot normal (most likely seminole) shitting up the place with his Facebook faggotry. you picked the wrong day to fuck around, asshole. i've just texted the a guidance (we're friends out of school) about this conversation, so he'll be here shortly to deal with the matter, and most likely hand out some sorely needed suspensions. i'm also going to report the conversation (for safe measure), as well as alert the other admins in the guidance office. and just in case you wanna try and pull a fast one, i'm recording the entire conversation for additional proof and e-mailing the super intendant about the matter personally. i'm tired of you stupid fucking dick sniffers pressing out whatever lolrandom faggot shit you want in the fucking tech school. it's time for you assholes to get a reality check, because this shit won't fly for much longer. prepare your anus, you 500 pound pile of shit. your days are fucking numbered

 As it stands this article is a piece of crap.  It reads like a lame defence of the artless sexploitation that's taken over mainstream music.  The lead is especially bad  there ARE studies which point out the negative effects of these videos.  The statements in defence of this stuff are vague to the point of meaninglessness.  What does """"hurt"""" mean in this case?  More importantly, what are the effects of this trend on MUSIC  what happens when talented musicians who don't act """"sexy"""" are shut out of the buisiness, and pop music becomes nothing more than lipsynching stripshows?  And why is hip-hop emphasized?  If this article is going to be valuable, it needs to cover things like Duran Duran's """"Girls on Film"""" and Motley Crue's """"Girls Girls Girls"""".  Madonna and her wannabe followers (Britney Spears, ect.) need to be covered.  The rampant sexualization of young girls needs to be covered.  Most of all, this article needs some balance  some mention of the many people who find this a cheap, exploitative trend  a way for big bizness to stablize the market: instead of taking chances with art and creativity (when they're so out of touch with actual music making they can't tell a hit from a shit) they cynically wipe the field clean of real (unreliable, difficult to manage) artists and pump the world full of guaranteed-to-get-a-reaction pornography soundtracked by freeze-dried zombie music and performed by circus-trained money-hungry strippers who are no longer expected to even sing on stage.  The commodification of music is fueled by the increasing emphasis on sexuality and SEX SEX SEX is the number one reason big bizness music is both omnipresent and creatively bankrupt.  If I can find the time I will improve this article, just because it pissed me off so much.  I hope others will join me.  (Personally, I enjoy music AND pornography.  But the exploitation of both results in DEAD PRODUCT.  I can neither jerk off nor rock out to this zombie crap.  And I fear this crap is eating a hole in the souls of our young people.

 What is Muhammad? 
 If we look at it from a science point of view, he is a false prophet, as Mateusz (disciple of Jesus)  in verse 24 tell us that there will be many false Prophet that will bring fire, whips and war to the world which are common now a day’s brought to us by the devil’s descendants. 
 One logically question will be, if Good would send Jesus his son, to tell people to be forgiven, to name the woman as equal to the man, and then less that 400 years after that, change his mind? 
 Good is not that kind of “person” that changes his minds. No, we got our self a Muhammad, pedophile, sex fixated and criminal, that with weapons in his hand try to suppress the world and its inhabitants with violence, fire, rape and deep racism. – So he proved that his arguments are so weak, that spoken words are too poor to convince the world. Only flames and war is the chance, which is if he can win. 
 In other words, one of the biggest pigs that have lived on earth until to now, together with Poll Pot, Mao, Hitler, Stalin and other despots. This of course will bring us at war with all his followers that even denied eating flesh from pigs. My bee it’s because they have been so advanced though, that they abandon cannibalism? We don’t know, but it’s likely, a pedophile, sex fixated warlord, is a pig, - no less. 
 That Islam has a lot of common values with all other despots’  in history, tells the fact, that the Mufti  of Jerusalem during Hitler time, moved to Berlin to be with one person of common interest, Murder, rape and rubbery from decent people, just like they do today, by traveling to Europe, just to claim “Dhimmy” from the European people. Making rape legal, because they have been brought up to believe that, European girls are free to take as the like. Racism? We think so, equal to Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. 
 With Islam follows, violence, bombs, killings, war and suppression, Islam has so far not brought anything than problems to the world. Look at the world, wherever there is war Islam is on the one side and mostly on the other too. 
 Devil’s followers, ore Muhammad’s, no difference, will burn in hell as they live on a lei in life, provoking the world to do something about the problem. There are about 1 billion monkeys to many on earth, these spices call themselves Islamist or was it Muslims, and ore, only mislead humans with some permittivity left from the creation? We are not sure.    
 Destroy all Islamist fascists or…. Become a slave!

 As it's said in the wiki article, nothing has been conclusively proven. Yes, you can say that survey found """"black people are bigger on average"""". But It is less credible than the sizesurvey.com survey because of a lack of any information on the Methodology used and other details. It only has the results. So no credibility at all, and of no use in the wikipedia article. I mean they can't even spell. Looks like a page someone quickly made up to attract viewers (searching on """"penis size) to see their sex personal ads plastered all over the place.  

 If you find a better source which details that survey feel free to add it to the others in wiki article. Even then (with methodology details), it probably won't prove anything (being a self-measured study), and will only be useful noting as anecdotal evidence.  

 Same as the sizesurvey.com survey. You used a good quote which shows it's lack of credibility for showing racial size differences (this is already noted in wiki article). But the same is true of the Jakinworld survey. The sample size of Africans was too low to be of use (1.7%). So I would say both the sizesurvey.com survey and the Jakinworld survey are lacking in credibility for comparing racial sizes. I'd say we should either have both in the article (for fairness and neutrality) as weak anecdotal evidence or not have either. It is questionable.    

 Coolnurse.com doesn't even know where the survey information came from. Interesting read, but not credible. 

 If better studies and surveys are done that conclusively show """"black"""" people are larger on average as a whole (race), then yes, that should be published whether """"diet or god gave it to them"""". As of now, studies show too many discrepancies to make any conclusion.  

 Ok. That was a bit of a mind-bender to all contemplate. I think I need to take a break from this article. Penis Penis Penis... Blah Blah.. Heh. Good debate though. Kudos.

 I think the article should say more about mafias in habbo because in the UK version having or working in a mafia is one of the most popular things to do.

 :Is there a credible source on this? I would be interested in reading it. If its there, amend the article to include that at the end?    
 ::ebaumsworld, 4chan's /b/, and encyclopedia dramatica organized the raid.  I don't know if there's a good source.  Goto habbo right now, especially by pools.  That's what people said.    
 ::: Is this related to the Gaia Online blockade that is in a caption, per chance? I think people invest way too much time into this... (er, replace invest with waste)    
 ::::Until there's a credible source that Gaia Online are involved, I've removed the pic. Also, it's a fair use image which doesn't add to the article. It's just vanity on the part of 4chan.  // bornhj   

 #There's no such thing as 4chan

 ::Dude. You're obviously being an idiot. And you're overlooking SomethingAwful and Encyclopaedia Dramatica. And I have never heard of blackplanet prior to your insane claim. Also, Gaia's kind of doubtable, since a lot of 4channers are just trolling in attempts to get Gaia in trouble.

 == Alleged Original Research == 

 I have added back a load of content that was removed supposedly under the reasoning that it was """"original research"""". First, there was reliably sourced content that was removed. The """"Changes in direction"""" section was already reliably sourced as were the quotes. How that falls under original research I'll never know. The show underwent some major changes and to omit that one of the main characters was killed off makes no sense whatsoever. The fact that two of the main stars, John Amos and Esther Rolle, publicly complained about the series and ultimately left because of it also doesn't fall under OR. This was covered by the media as evidenced by the sources that were present. If someone had a problem with Ebony and The LA Times being reliable sources, they should have dropped a note here instead of removing a shit ton of content that someone took the time to write (not me) and another person (me) took the time to source. Original research isn't including details about the work, it's drawing your own conclusions based on your own research. In television show articles, we can use the work itself as a source for the actual details of the show. Once the writing start veering off into overly detailed garbage, that's when the OR police can come out. Works of fiction should have some details about production, ratings, show changes, etc. If not, all we have is an article that say a show aired and some people were in it. It took me all of 20 minutes to find sources for the majority of the removed content - none of it was contentious nor was it OR which means it should not have been removed. Ironically, actual original research about the stupid opening titles was left in.  """,1

 :  To be as polite as possible, fuck you and your """"eternal war"""" wikipedia philosophy.  Now for the specific areas in which this article was a horrible loss from day one: 

 :  """"the philosophies under the rubric of left anarchism are sometimes called """"collectivist anarchism"""" to distinguish from individualist anarchist philosophies."""" - This creates a false dichotomy, given that many individualist anarchists consider themselves leftists. 

 : """"""""Left anarchists"""" consider capitalism, most notably wage labour and often private ownership of the means of production, as being a coercive or exploitative institution. As an alternative to private ownership, they advocate collectivist ownership.""""  Not true.  SOME left anarchists advocate collective ownership, some do not.   

 :  """"The position of individualist anarchism in this scheme is a matter of dispute since these anarchists have favored some aspects of capitalism but opposed others;""""  is worded wrong.  By this wording, one could say that the traditional anarchists favor some aspects of capitalism, because the implication is that capitalism in entailed by some of the things individualists supported.  But it isn't, thus, the wording gives the wrong impression.   """,1

 You bet! Here it is: 

 Muslim scholars take this as proof that bahaullah was a decietful liar . If he was the messaih of Islam, he wouldn't take pictures, knowing that it is against Islam. 

 == I didn't do this, But GOOD JOB SIR! == 

 Check this edit out! I give my thanks to whoever did it! 

 The Truth About Bahaullah 

 He was a liar according to everybody in the world. He is promised Hell Fire in the following religions: 
 ::1. Islaam (He lied and he knew he was a liar)  
 ::2. Judaism (He preached against Yahweh)  
 ::3. Christianity (He pretended to be Jesus)  
 ::4. Hinduism (He ate meat)  
 ::5. Jainism (He killed living creatures)  
 ::6. Atheists (He was mentally retarted) 

 So, it is safe to say that one men who will definately'' be in Hell is Bahá'u'lláh!

 == [citation needed] == 

 I had read somewhere that essentially many people that didn't have positive interactions with their caregivers in early childhood, only negative ones (heavy beatings could be one) become sadists and/or masochists. They have no choice but to love such parent(s) (they have no other options, unless this is a commune) so they confuse hurting with helping and get effed up arousal/romance styles. Like knives/electricity/burning/hanging/mutilation/crotch attacks/feces eating/slavery/butt fucking till the anus bleeds, or, in milder cases, lower amounts of suffering. (spectrum between normal romantic/sex relationships and inability to form them) This almost makes too much sense to need citation but (typical of """"people sciences"""") Googling """"causes of masochism"""" shows only hypotheses and this is not one of them. However, there are citations for at least 30% of child abuse victims abusing their children and masochists outnumbering sadists. And some sadists probably want to abuse their children but don't cause consenting masochists won't get them in trouble. I hypothesize that the relatively small S&M; research community's laissez faire-ness and inability to feel that Orwellian reversal of the injury-prevention drive of self preservation is perverse causes it to not think of this. Also the Google hits are all copied from what appears to be the DSM. Psychiatrists are often cold people who analyse humans like objects and many S&Ms; say giving pain is love (again the good is bad, bad is good Newspeak thing again) so a love-based theory is not really in their personality toolkit. 

 (Psychiatry is also almost the study of fucked up-ness (a guy who's vertical 24/7 — thinks he's a spillable glass of juice, afraid of people drinking him, lol) they must be jaded to effed up ppl..)  

 Anyway, the DSM hypotheses seem wishy-washy to me compared to the one I support (Freud's ones usually do too, and look how those turned out). Shouldn't there be a version of Occam's Razor that says that the social sciences theory that seems least mushy to non-wishy washy doctorates is most likely to be correct? 

 If I was misinterpreted, my main point was that I don't want to experience an intercourse that's more pleasurable than regular intercourse. I want to retain the ability to have intercourse with different kinds of people without it being second-best, not just the kinkier than average. 

 Also, I'm aware that women have different thresholds where pain starts and anus tightnesses and it doesn't hurt some. And that some female prostates are more sensitive than others. I'd still be concerned if she's 5'0"""" and being/practically demanding me to """"pound my ass faster!"""". I'm now reminded that I generally fantasized anal sex with adult girls in 5th grade because I thought it was fairer. You know, a penis size to anus width thing. Peer girls were hotter, I imagined them with unusually loose anuses.   """,1

There's no need to dismiss someone like that, not because we're all looking for the fainting couch but because it's designed to be maximally dismissive and provocative. You told someone they weren't worth listening to in the first comment. It's completely fine to tell someone their opinion needs to be backed up with evidence but there's no reason to do so like you did. It demeans any sense of level debate and coarsens things needlessly. Sure, if someone is pissing you off or not getting the point, responding like you did would be perfectly reasonable! We will all be blunt and discourteous when we're in a rush or egged on or whatever. In that context, what you said above is pretty tame (even around here). But you seemed to assume that posture the instant someone made an assertion you didn't like. If they felt they were making a reasonable contribution to the discussion (a comment such as theirs is pretty common in RfCs and elsewhere), then what were they to think when you reacted as you did? Should they have thanked you for your implicit education in how tough the real world is by comparison? Maybe leaving the discussion or ignoring the slight is easier. I certainly understand why people you've treated like crap wouldn't readily confront you about it. What would they gain from doing so? All I'm saying is don't be a jerk.

 The paragraph says: 

 Although the ultimate origin of the word """"slut"""" is unknown, it first appeared in Middle English in 1402 as slutte (AHD), with the meaning """"a dirty, untidy, or slovenly woman"""".[5] Even earlier, Geoffrey Chaucer used the word sluttish (c. 1386) to describe a slovenly man; however, later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women.[5] The modern sense of """"a sexually promiscuous woman"""" dates to at least 1450/ 

 Now the first sentence says it FIRST appeared in 1402 but the second says EVEN EARLIER Chaucer used the word in 1386. Well then the FIRST use would have to be at least 1386 not the other way around. You idiots at Wikipedia leave stupid nonsense like this standing because you are a bunch of sluts who spend your time wanking instead of fixing your historical errors. And you eat crumpets.

 == The Term """"Dick Joke"""" Used Figuratively == 
 In private conversations among professional comedians, I've heard the term """"dick joke"""" get used to refer to any facile dumb humor that gets dropped in, as dumb *as if* it were literally just dick jokes.  Example: In the middle of a conversation with a good and sustained level of humor, someone drops in some just distractingly stupid joke, and then being told """"dammit!, why do you always have to go right to the dick joke!?"""" (when the joke in question wasn't an actual dick joke at all, just dumb and vulgar). Or: """"(some name) is a HACK He goes up and does eight minutes of dick jokes and he calls that a set!"""" (...where that might not involve *any* actual dick jokes, but humor about no smarter than a bunch of dick jokes.)  Ironically, this entry's example of a dick joke """"A professor gives his psychology class a spot quiz..."""" wouldn't count as a dick joke in the sense I'm talking about too much setup, and not broad enough... at all.  Also, about as funny as a glacier.  Anyway, for my sense of """"dick joke"""", I have no citation whatsoever it has come up repeatedly in conversation as a term of jargon, but I'm not putting it in this entry, because, like I say, no citation.  But, folks, keep listening, because maybe the sense I'm talking about will show up in some comedian's podcast or something. (I would say """"keep an ear cocked!"""", but please, I have some self-respect! Oh, wait, no, there it went.) —  """,1

 :""""Muslims are bloodthirsty maniacs who delightly in killing infidels, especially women and children."""" 

 :Note that I did not say anything about the truth or falsehood of the above statements - merely that they are not NPOV. 

 :But the following would be NPOV: 

 :""""According to CAIR and so-and-so and such-and-such, and other prominent Muslim theologians, Islam forbids attacks on civilian targets, and any attacks on civilians in the name of Islam are contrary to teachings of Islam.  However, according to Daniel Pipes, they are really apologists for terrorism, who half-heartedly condemn it strictly for PR purposes."""" 

 :""""The issue is further complicated by whats-his-name, who takes the view that attacks against civilian targets are permitted if they are in retaliation for enemy's attack on one's own civilian targets.  The extent to which this view represents the views of Muslims is in dispute.  According to Daniel Pipes, 95% of all Muslims think this.  But according to Prof. Dorkenburger, professor of Religious Studies at the University of Utana and author of 'You are an intolerant bastard', Daniel Pipes is an intolerant bastard."""" 

 :Daniel Pipes, Prof. Dorkenburger, Usama bin Laden, and people from CAIR could all read the above and agree that it describes the situation accurately.  This would not require them to agree on whether or not Mr. Pipes is an intolerant bastard, whether or not CAIR is lying through its teeth, whether or not Prof. Dorkenburger has the slightest clue, or whether or not the people in the WTC deserved to die.

 'One day he was out with a friend “in leopard, with high heels” who was half-Spanish, half-Vietnamese. Louboutin, who “was going to pee my pants”, used a restaurant toilet. 

 “The staff went crazy,” he tells me. “One guy grabbed my friend by her hair and started calling her a little bitch. I took my fist to him, and he screamed, ‘Don’t you dare touch a white guy or I’ll crush your nose even more flat than it is’”. I wasn’t in a black or mixed race family, so I had no experience of racism. But still, I was different.” He was so young at the time.

 == I'm going to make a computer program to mass-vandalize Wikipedia. == 

 Dear Wikipedia admins, 
 What is to prevent me from going ahead with the very sinister plan of making a program that connects to Wikipedia pages, vandalizes them, and simply resets my modem to a new IP address every time it gets blocked from editing?  You feeble HUMANS take five freakin' minutes to fix a single g*d damn vandalization, but a program could vandalize faster than you can say """"Oh, I'm a casual Wikipedia user reading all of this crap and I'm never going to use Wikipedia again.""""  Just kidding!  That's not actually my intention, but still, I am going to have SO MUCH FUN harassing the living daylights out of you phüçers because you would have to go and manually revert every single change and it would take all of you FIVE MINUTES!!!  In that time, people will have ALREADY started reading the vandalizations.  Hence I get my way. 

 Now, I'm not going to mess around with the text that's already there.  I respect the purpose of Wikipedia to provide an open community for everyone to contribute to make a constructive web site, and I don't want to undermine the information that is already on the pages.  HOWEVER, I will add jokes and nonsense and swear words and shit in between paragraphs and sentences. 

  
 Unless you can propose to me how you wish to counteract this.  If not, sayonara sucker fuckers!!!""",1

 That’s right, Iran. It was our drone. And it was spreading homosexual Western ideas over Iran. We call it the bone-drone. Get used to it, you fabulous bearded Mullahs! 
 Let me just say that the wording used for the recent """"Iran incident"""" was misleading at best. Most people do not know that International airspace starts 12 nautical miles off the coast... so saying that the incident SUPPOSEDLY (we should definitely keep the supposedly, unless you believe what professional liars and spin doctors feed you like it's the word of Dog - which wouldn't surprise me considering the MASSIVE INFLUX OF RIGHT WING SCUM, SHILLS AND PROVOCATEURS WHO'VE INVADED WIKIPEDIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS AND TURNED IT INTO A CESSPOOL) happened 16 miles from Iran does not make sense. It makes more sense to tell the god damned mother fucking truth and say that it SUPPOSEDLY occurred FOUR (4) miles from Iranian air space....while we (the USA) were SUPPOSEDLY using an expensive to operate piece of military equipment to do surveillance and recon over OPEN OCEAN WATERS... because the navy is into bird watching and flora fauna type shit... especially so close where Iran has extensive military and industrial facilities... because our leaders HAVEN'T totally admitted that we violate Iran's airspace all the time and will continue to do so despite the loss of the drone they SUPPOSEDLY hacked or whatever happened to it.    

  
 Hello there Mr. """"Semi-Retired"""" ... The biased, rash, inflammatory, speculative, antagonistic and sensationalist (3) article which are cited actually do back up the modifications I made.

6cf28d9ee2422dd9,"== Pame number system doesn't appear to be base 8 == 

 Going through the article linked as a citation, if you scroll down to the actual words, you'll notice a few things. 
 First, the number 8 does have significance. The word for 9 (nda ntsaw? nda) is made from putting together the words for 8 (nda ntsaw?) and 1 (nda). But that's not enough to say that they have a base 8 number system. 

 The word for 10 isn't made from putting together the words for 8 and 2. 10 gets its own word: seska?ai. 
 The word for 11 isn't made from putting together 8 and 3. It's made from putting together 10 and 1: seska?ai nda 

 Similarly for all the numbers between 10 and 20. 16 is 10 and 6, 19 is 10 and 9, etc. 
 There's no entry on the list for a word meaning 64. A language that uses base 8 obviously would have a separate word for 64. 

 There is a word for 100: nda ntswa?. 
 And 200: nui ntswa? 
 And 300: renhu? ntswa? 

 Unsurprisingly, nda, nui, and renhu? are similar to the words for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

 It's not a base 8 language. It's a base 10 language with a special word for 8.",0

85dedc2a3bb70f87,"What To Keep In Mind While Buying Soda Dispensers  

 Innovation is riding on a high wave in every industry. From book printing to beverages, nothing is left untouched by it. Few decades back, we had only heard of colas but now there are dispensers available for everything. Punch bowls, champagne fountains, insulated beverage carriers, juice dispensers and carbonated beverage dispensers are all used by restaurants, caterers, kids’ stores and other convenience stores all over the world. 

 The scope of this article is to cover the things that are kept in mind for CO2 dispensing Los Angeles. Manufacturers have developed a unique line of Southern California Soda dispensing equipment which has been designed to help commercial hubs reach their two goals – reduction in cost and increase in profits. 

 Los Angeles beverage equipment 
 The Los Angeles beverage equipment uses its patented state-of-the-art technology to offer it’s every customer a soda unit with unparalleled reliability, performance and economy. They have used a highly efficient design to give Los Angeles soda fountains capability to deliver soda anytime throughout the year. 

 Some of the other innovative features that this soda dispensing unit uses are – sealed system, ability to keep the temperature constant and variable horsepower. Variations in temperature of soda dispensing unit can lead to a number of time-consuming and costly dispensing issues in the long run. A good soda dispensing unit eliminates such problems by making use of a constantly running compressor which is linked with two mechanical controls that provides a very accurate temperature control. Soda temperatures are maintained with literally zero differential degrees which is very much like conventional systems that have thermostatic controls which allow temperature fluctuations. 

 Another major problem that happens often with soda dispensing units is related to contamination. Condensed contamination can result in capacity loss and costly service bills. It is therefore necessary to find a solution that saves not only of after sales service but also give you a good service for years to come.",0

 == Treatments for Pain Autism == 

 I didn't add anything but hope someone will take the time to provide the research for these two items I'm touching on...  

 As the parent of a child on the spectrum, I know that many people (children and adults) are prescribed Elavil and other SSRI's """"Off-label"""" to treat anxious behaviors associated with ASDs. I read an article (Medscape) on how alarming it is that so many off-label drugs are prescribed for autistic youths (I'm not surprised... enough aren't tried IMO.  Elavil, Sertraline, Paxil and Prozac are all used to treat ASD's. TMK only sertraline is approved for autistic youths over the age of 6 to treat anxiety.  
 Further, the association of using SSRIs to treat pain-involved symptoms and syndromes do not alleviate the pain, they alleviate the stress/anxiety of/from both pain and the idea of the pain.  
 For example, I've a friend I call a """"pain wuss"""". she has no tolerance for pain whatsoever and what's worse is she FEARS pain to the point that if she knows something will cause pain, the anxiety will cause her to feel pain that is not there.  She had a major surgery. I was there pre-operatively to discuss pain management with the surgeon. He blah-blah'd me when I reminded him of the issue of my friend not only needing pain meds but something to handle the anxiety from the pain. He said it was handled. It was not. Post-operatively, even with a pain block, no pain killer alleviated the pain. My friend suffered horribly until I hollered at a nurse (who was in disbelief that there could still be so much pain with the morphine drip and additionally administered pain meds) that it wasn't the pain, it was the anxiety FROM the pain that was keeping her awake even after receiving enough morphine to knok out an elephant. She was finally given something for anxiety, and she passed out, relieved. Dealing with chronic pain is a stressor that can cause more  or cause perceived pain. I know I've read things about this and experienced it but I'm no encyclopedia. I bet one of you more clever Wiki people know right where to go though, and the information may be helpful to a few folks.

2fb4abe68f67e1ca,"""== Philosophy Passion for Truth == 

 PASSION FOR TRUTH  
 Anybody who is indifferent whether something is true or not is in a grave danger of loosing any meaning of his/her life. Skepticism   seems to be  a trivial an shallow mode of living without any depth and  values taken seriously. One can say that skepticism is a mental narrowness, timidity and simply inexplicable denial of thinking . Thought  is the outstanding difference  between  the homo sapiens and other forms of life, therefore not using one's mind to the fullest  one sentences one's own existence to  chaotic  ultimately meaningless  existential emptiness.  In order to be truly living a human life one needs to  be not only interested in  truth  but one must become a passionate  searcher  for one's sense of living , suffering, and dying. The development of technology , the explosion of science,  and the radical broadening  of men's  mental horizons  is undoubtedly  great blessing for the human race. But science, technology and  modernization of life shall not be able to answer  the most important questions for any thinking person. Such questions as  who or what is man?, why do I exist ?  why is there a universe at all ?, what happens when I die? Are we alone  in this unfeeling  cold universe of matter alone or is it true that the highest levels of being  are mental in nature? Does some God exist   or are religious believers suffering  some kind of mysterious delusion?  

              Such questions are extremely important for  my self-understanding , the sense of nonsense  of my existence  and most importantly my awareness of values , primarily moral values: what is morally good or morally evil . Why be moral at all?. Perhaps the demands of moral conscience  are a constricting  suffocating unnecessary and absurd burden in my life and nothing else  and therefore  should be relegated to the times of the Dark Ages.  Those are crucial problems to which science as such, that is experimental science,  is incompetent to give any solid  answers . Why so? - Because  science deals primarily with description and mathematical expression of facts only .  But by itself   science  will never give me any solid answer to the above questions. If a person limits his/ her knowledge to what is """" scientifically proven only """" he/she already sentences himself /herself to mental blindness relative to the most important questions of human existence. The most universal obstacles to passionate search for truth are very many  fear of the unknown , fear of thinking seriously , a desire for easy living and spending one's time in shallow and empty but exciting form or entertainment.  

               To be human is to exist towards death as   Martin Heidegger  defined  man  """"A being toward death.""""  The mystery of death always was  and always is  a fascinating  riddle for any thinking person . Albert Camus  although not a believer in any  sort of God confessed however  his  desire and absolute demand for meaning when he said  that to die knowing why  and for what is acceptable, but to see the meaning of life melt into nothingness is not anything one can live with. 
                 The time of life is short and one is obligated to make  a decision what to believe or not  because not to make a decision is to make a decision. By evading  my commitment  I already am accepting some vision of existence. There is no other way open for humans. That is why the passion for truth must be  in the short period of life a living dynamism of man's intellectual life. No one  can sit on two branches at the same time . The saying of  Jesus Christ comes to mind at this point  Who is not with me is against me. There is no in between  fence  sitting . The search for truth  must be done by everyone and it cannot be pushed away to somebody else. Why, because I can live my life only myself and nobody else can live it for me , experience for me, the joy of living, creativity, suffering  and  the whole adventure of existing. Because of my egocentric predicament   my vision always is and will be mine. This is why whether I am indifferent,  occasionally only interested in truth or not at all is all another call for passion for truth. When Pilate     sentenced Christ to death, he  interrogated  Christ about His mission and nature. Christ answered that He was born  to witness to Truth. Pilate  looked at him  with cynicism  in his eyes and said  what is truth?,  - but he did not wait for an answer he  thought that there are many other duties of a Roman governor more important than  such abstract  and fuzzy   concept.  There was no such attitude possible for Pilate  as passion for truth.

 a member of an ancient Jewish sect, distinguished by strict observance of the traditional and written law, and commonly held to have pretensions to superior sanctity. 
 • a self-righteous person; a hypocrite. 
 The Pharisees are mentioned only by Josephus and in the New Testament. Unlike the Sadducees, who tried to apply Mosaic law strictly, the Pharisees allowed some freedom of interpretation. Although in the Gospels they are represented as the chief opponents of Jesus, they seem to have been less hostile than the Sadducees to the nascent Church, with which they shared belief in the Resurrection.

 ==Michael Redd III a.k.a. Why I accused you of vandalism== 
 :It's not necessarily vandalism (although negotiable, see below), but I knew it would get your attention. 

 :1.) You need to post reasons for your edits, especially if you are reverting the edits made by others. Anyone can change Wikipedia; you do not own Wikipedia or the means by which it operates. If you undo somebody's work, you must say why. 

 :2.) We have discussed the nickname citations before on your talk page and resolved that it should remain the way it is, without citations. I was very hospitable, and we did hammer out a conclusion. About a week later, however, you went ahead and changed it again, claiming that a citation was """"blocked up,"""" despite the fact that the citation you reverted to had nothing to do with the point it was supposed to validate. 

 :3.) The article was locked because of this edit war. It was lifted presuming that you had relented, and then you came back anyway. Didn't you notice that it was locked at one point? 

 :4.) Every time I undo your edits with those useless, clutterful links, I tell you to check the discussion page. Have you ever, even once, checked there? I have my rationale listed in point form, so anyone can understand. That fact that you ask """"And why are you re-instating uncited material,"""" tells me that out of the million times I have directed you to the discussion page, you have never checked it. 

 :5.) I do know what vandalism is, and I believe that reversing useful information is vandalism. In your last edit, you undid two interesting items from the Trivia section. If I went and undid all of the work that you did in any given page, that would be vandalism because I would be tearing down established material and, if I were like you, I wouldn't give a reason. 

 :I posted this also on my talk page so you might see it there as well. Sorry to sound harsh, but that's the way it is. It does not need a citation for the reasons I have stated in the discussion page, and a moderator has agreed with me in this instance although not in all instances, so it is not a general rule. As I have mentioned before, the spirit of Wikipedia is more important than the letter because, in theory, you could cite every sentence and maybe every word in an article, but nobody expects you to because of the vague """"debatable"""" guideline. Everything is potentially dubious and debatable, so do we cite everything? I think I explained it better in the discussion page... please consult.

 ==Aetna 2010 NYC contracts== 

  has added important information about a current Aetna contract dispute in NYC. However, the great level of detail about this dispute is quite inconsistent with the rest of the article, as is the extended back-and-forth quoted dialogue. This article is probably not the place for a detailed airing of ongoing grievances against the company. And, critically, the sourcing of this detail is all very weak and below Wikipedia standards. It includes: press releases; a corporate web site; and a link to the subscription page for an online newspaper. I suggest a reversion to the """"13:04, 28 June 2010"""" version of the article, which includes sufficient information about this particular contract dispute.

 == Protection from radiation Comment == 

 Reading the discussions, I am not the first to notice and am in no way appeased by statements such as, """"I admit the article needs some work."""" 

 Long before I reached this subheading I was fairly certain I was reading an advertisement for snake oil.  A bit of clarification would be helpful here.  For instance: Are the properties which limit damage to the human body from radiation related to the properties by which Melatonin reduces the effect of voodoo curses?  This is important to the few who may have been born not only with a functioning brain but also armed with skepticism and not afraid to use it. 

 Not worried about Fukushima?  Then try it as a recreational drug like Marijuana, or maybe even LSD!  No?  Then how about using it to kick that cocaine habit!  Sex life got you down?  Melatonin is the drug supplement for you!  Also good for fire ant infestation, global warming and acne!   

 I'm a fraction of a tick away from lobbying for deletion. 

    

 :It may be snake oil as it stands, but there could be something to it. Melatonin is an antioxidant, as the article covers (I think); and absence of melatonin (as in shift work disorder) is linked to cancers...   16:12 5 May 2011 (GMT) 

 ::Something that is pretty much as bad as a snake oil salesman is someone who claims something is snake oil based on preconceptions rather than the scientific evidence. It is clear from the scientific evidence that melatonin has significant antioxidant properties, and various physiological effects as a result, including (obviously?) reducing the effect of various toxins (some of which are carcinogenic) and radiation. But presumably the fact that this statement includes the words """"antioxidant"""" and suggests medically significant benefits makes it automatically """"snake-oil"""" to someone who then has the arrogance to suggest there should be no article on melatonin in wikipedia (perhaps he believes the chemical should be deleted from metabolic pathways as well? ) )

 ::Try his anti-Stalin speech for starters.   
 ::This term automatically rendered it unnecessary that the ideological errors of a man or men engaged in a controversy be proven; this term made possible the usage of the most cruel repression, violating all norms of revolutionary legality, against anyone who in any way disagreed with Stalin, against those who were only suspected of hostile intent, against those who had bad reputations. This concept, enemy of the people, actually eliminated the possibility of any kind of ideological fight or the making of one's views known on this or that issue, even those of a practical character. In the main, and in actuality, the only proof of guilt used, against all norms of current legal science, was the confession of the accused himself, and, as subsequent probing proved, confessions were acquired through physical pressures against the accused. 
 ::Stalin, on the other hand, used extreme methods and mass repressions at a time when the revolution was already victorious, when the Soviet state was strengthened, when the exploiting classes were already liquidated, and Socialist relations were rooted solidly in all phases of national economy, when our party was politically consolidated and had strengthened itself both numerically and ideologically. It is clear that here Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power. Instead of proving his political correctness and mobilizing the masses, he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party and the Soviet Government. Here we see no wisdom but only a demonstration of the brutal force which had once so alarmed V.I Lenin 
 ::Now when the cases of some of these so-called spies and saboteurs were examined it was found that all their cases were fabricated. Confessions of guilt of many- arrested and charged with enemy activity were gained with the help of cruel and inhuman tortures 
 ::Very grievous consequences, especially in reference to the beginning of the war, followed Stalin's annihilation of many military commanders and political workers during 1937-41 because of his suspiciousness and through slanderous accusations. During these years repressions were instituted against certain parts of military cadres beginning literally at the company and battalion commander level and extending to the higher military centers; during this time the cadre of leaders who had gained military experience in Spain and In the Far East was almost completely liquidated 
 ::The question arises: Why is it that we see the truth of this affair only now, and why did we not do something earlier, during Stalin's life, in order to prevent the loss of innocent lives? It was because Stalin personally supervised the Leningrad affair, and the majority of the Political Bureau members did not, at that time, know all of the circumstances in these matters, and could not therefore intervene 
 ::Clearly the rantings of an """"anti-communist""""?   
 ::Stalin's willfulness vis-a-vis the Party and its Central Committee be came fully evident after the XVIIth Party Congress which took place in 1934. It was determined that of the 139 members and candidates of the Party's Central Committee who were elected at the XVIIth Congress; 98 persons, i.e., 70 percent, were arrested and shot (mostly in 1937- 1938). 
 :: All those who interested themselves even a little in the national situation saw the difficult situation in agriculture, but Stalin never even noted it. Did we tell Stalin about this? Yes, we told him, but he did not support us. Why? Because Stalin never traveled anywhere, did not meet city and kolkhoz workers; he did not know the actual situation in he provinces. He knew the country and agriculture only from films. And these films had dressed up and beautified the existing situation in agriculture. 
 ::Gosh  an """"anti-communist"""" pointing out that Stalin knew of what was happening on the farms?

Sageross gave us the heads up that your class had started working on articles in sandboxes, which is great! I looked over what you have so far on the Niqab in Egypt, and here's some ideas for how you can improve it: 

 * Add a brief section explaining what a niqab is and how it differs from the hijab and the burqu 
 * Add links to relevant topics (see this edit for a sample) 
 * Copyedit to remove typos and avoid inconsistences, such as the italicization of some Arabic words but not others 
 * Start playing around with the footnote system for references 

 It's obvious from the notes you've left (""""talk about niqab and bombing??"""") that you intend to expand upon what you've already written, so some of the issues I've mentioned may work themselves out as you continue to edit. Keep up the good work!  ·  """,0

59e6b393c392a2d4,":You still don't get history and I'm sure you'll never do. Mongols came to rape Persians (Farsibans) after Ghurid rule ended. History makes it very clear that the policy of Genghis Khan (Mongol) was to erace the Persian culture completely and this is why his Mongol army whiped out Persian cities, killing every Persian including their pets and live stocks, and etc. The Persian women may have been spared in some cases if they were selected as wife of Mongol army troops. As a result the children were born as Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, (Northern Afghans) with faces resembling their fathers (Mongols) and speaking their mothers' language (Farsi or Persian). The Persian areas got this complete make-over when Mongols invaded in 13th century and nobody can deny this, it's well documented and the proof is in the faces of Tajiks, Azeris, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and etc. Tajiks are known for having long Donkey faces with eyes of a Mongol. Mongols did not invade Punjab region, where many Pashtuns safely fled to at the time. Majority of them came back within time to where they live today but some stayed on the eastern side of the Indus river among the Indian people. Pashtuns don't have any Mongol faces, that's enough proof that they never mixed with Mongols. Plus, there is no such record of any Mongols entering Pashtun areas (Sulieman mountains). Mongols hated Pashtuns so much because only Pashtuns gave real resistance to them and this is why you (being a descendant of Mongols) hate Pashtuns so much untilt this day. 

 :Since you only throw farts and don't know how to present truth during your attacks on Pashtuns, I'll show you how. The following is 100% true video clip in which your Shia (Shiite head) mother is getting gang raped by 4 Azeri-Mongols in Iran. If you enjoy seeing deaths and killings that site is full of it. The Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks have trouble feeding themselves and they learned their lesson not to fuck with Pashtuns. For the last 30 years you lame ass suckers have been fighting Pashtuns and look what you have done to yourselves. You are nameless and can't even feed your family while the rest of the Islamic world has progressed so rapidly. You live in crowded cities of Afghanistan (land of the Afghans or Pashtuns) and if just one major earthquake was to occur in Kabul you Tajiks will experiance what the people of Haiti in Port-o Prince experianced. Pashtuns live in open plain land where each house or family owns 100s of acres of land. Pashtuns follow Saudi Arabia and Tajiks like you follow Shiite Iran. By the way I don't speak Farsi (Persian), which is a language that borrowed many words from Arabic, Pashto, and others. Pashto is much older language than the Farsi or Dari (Persian) you cunts speak today. Pashto language originates from Pahlavi. Older languages are determined by its usage in modern times, the reason why Pashto language is not used so much today is because it is a very old language, just like Hebrew, Aramaic, Sanskrit, and etc., which are also not used much today. Older languages are always slowly replaced with newer ones, and this is why many Pashtuns speak Persian (Dari) or Urdu today because these 2 are newer languages. If you are not a bastard like most Shia Tajiks are, your asshole mother or father will tell you that during the past the people in Iran spoke a completely different Persian language, which was whiped out during the Mongols time. 

 :You Shias are misled by Shia-taan (satan), Shias are Shiateen (devils). Dr. Zakir Naik is the only Muslim to spread Islam by media and the only people in the world who hate Zakir Naik are Shiites, not Christians, not Jews, not Hindus, not Buddhists, not Athiests, etc. This is clear proof that Shiites are non-muslims and the real enemies of Islam. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) has stated that Islam would be divided into 73 sects and all will go to hell except those who believe in all his companions. Sunnis are those who believe in all the companions of prophet Muhammad (pbuh), AND, Shiites (Shias) do not believe in Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, etc. So obviously Shias are going to hell. Not only this, they actually curse them, along with prophet Muhammad's wife Aisha and others. I am 100% convinced that all Shias will go to hell.Anthony Scianna",0

58f13cdff24de0c8,"=Widerlegung von Apollo 11 anhand der Treibstoffbilanz für die Flugflugbahn==  

 1. Die 2. Kosmische Geschwindigkeit von vB=11 km/s  

 Die Version der NASA laut Wikipedia im Juli 2013 zum Start von Apollo 11 in den Kosmos: „Apollo 11 startete am 16. Juli 1969 um 13:32:00 UTC an der Spitze der 2940 Tonnen schweren Saturn V von Cape Canaveral, Florida und erreichte zwölf Minuten später planmäßig die Erdumlaufbahn. Nach anderthalb Erdumkreisungen wurde die dritte Raketenstufe erneut gezündet. Sie brannte etwa sechs Minuten lang und brachte das Apollo-Raumschiff auf Mondkurs. Kurze Zeit später wurde das Kommando/Servicemodul (CSM) an die Landefähre angekoppelt.“ Wie sollte denn dies bitte geschehen? Das Apolloraumschiff  wurde auf Mondkurs gebracht, also nach einer logischen Interpretation mit 11 km/s in den Kosmos gestartet und dann erst erfolgte die Kopplung mit dem Lunamodul. Dies ist doch absoluter Schwachsinn!  

 Nun unbeirrt zur Logik und zu den physikalisch-mathematischen Berechnungen von Apollo 11 zur Verifizierung oder Falsifizierung von Apollo 11 anhand der Treibstoffbilanz für die Flugbahn:     

 Um mit einem Raumkörper zum Mond gelangen zu können, muss zunächst einmal die Fluchtgeschwindigkeit, also die 2. Kosmische  Geschwindigkeit von ca. 11 km/s erzielt werden. Nach Aussagen der NASA befand sich Apollo 11 mit dem Kommando-Service-Modul (im folgenden CSM) mit einer Gesamtmasse von Mo= 44 t (nach NASA-Angaben mit  4 t Treibstoff) in der Erdumlaufbahn mit ca. 8 km/s.  Um die Differenzgeschwindigkeit von 3 km/s zu erzielen und aus dem Schwerefeld der Erde in den Kosmos zu gelangen, wäre bereits eine zusätzliche Treibstoffmenge entsprechend der mathematisch transformierten Raketengrundgleichung    
 vB= ve * ln (Ml+ MTr): Ml  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (1) 
    
 und Umstellung nach MTr von  

 MTr= (2,72 3:2,6 -1)*40 t =2,72 1,2 -1)*40 t = (3,3-1)*40 t= 2,3*40 t= 92 t 	             	  	 (2) 

 erforderlich gewesen.  Es standen aber laut NASA-Angaben  nur 4 t zur Verfügung! 

 2. Die Wirkung der Gravitation von Erde und Mond auf das CSM von Apollo 11   

 Um die Wirkung der Gravitation von Erde und Mond auf das CSM zu berechnen, muss man sich des Gravitationsgesetzes bedienen. Aus dem Newtonschen Gravitationsgesetz lässt sich folgende allgemeine Relation ableiten, die den Zusammenhang zwischen den beiden Gravitationsbeschleunigungen g1 (vom Zentralkörper) und g2 (vom Raumschiff) und den beiden Radien r1 (Radius eines Zentralkörpers, z.B. der der Erde) und r2 (Entfernung des Raumschiffes zu einem Gravitationskörper, z.B. CSM) widerspiegeln: 

 g2=g1*r1² 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (3) 
            r2²  

 Auf ein Raumschiff, beispielsweise auf das CSM von Apollo 11 in einer Entfernung von r von der Erde mit dem Radius R bezogen, kann damit formuliert werden: 
 
 gr= gE*R² 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (4) 
             r²  
 Nun muss die Formel (4) integriert und durch r dividiert werden, um die durchschnittliche Gravitationsbeschleunigung gr berechnen zu können. Die durchschnittliche Gravitationsgröße gr errechnet sich zu  
                    r                            r   
 gr= gE *R² ∫  1  = gE *R² | -1 |. 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (5) 
              r   R   r²           r      r   R 
 
 Nun muss die Entfernung von der Erde bis zum Punkt r bestimmt werden, wo die 11 km/s an Fluchtgeschwindigkeit quasi auf Null durch die Wirkung der durchschnittlichen Gravitationsbeschleunigung gr abgebremst werden. Dazu muss die transformierte und umgestellte Formel (5) mit  

 gr=   v² 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (6) 
       2*r 

 gleichgesetzt werden. Es gilt dann, wie gezeigt werden kann 

 r=   -gE*2R². 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 (7) 
       v²- gE*2R 

 Damit ergibt sich für  

 r=     -2*9,89 * 6340000² m     = 180.657 km . 	  	  	  	  	  	 (8) 
      11.000² - 2*9,89*6340.000  
 
 Die Entfernung zum Mond beträgt damit immerhin noch ca. 220.000 km (400.000 km-180.000 km).  Die durchschnittliche positive Beschleunigung bis zum Mond nimmt dann einen Wert nach (5) von: 

 g(220.000 km)= 1,62*[(      -1740² km²)        )  - (      -1740² km²     )] ≈ 0,0078 m/s²              	 (9) 
                               220.000 *220.000 km²    1740*220.000 km² 

 an. Damit wird das CSM von Apollo 11 bis auf eine Geschwindigkeit zum Mond von 

 v=√2*220.000.000 m*0,0078 m/s²= 2620 m/s² 

 beschleunigt.  

 3. Der Flug von CSM in die Mondumlaufbahn, die Landung auf dem Mond und der Rückflug    

 Um in die Mondumlaufbahn zu münden, mussten die 2,62 km/s auf rund 1600 m/s abgebremst werden. Damit wäre eine zusätzliche Treibstoffmenge von 

 MTr= (2,72 2,6 1::2,6 -1)*40 t =(2,720,38-1)*40 t (1,46 -1)*40 t",0

 ::::::::::::::: well, (1) what you said, """"ROC occupied Taiwan on behalf of the Allied Powers. It was a military occupation"""" this is your WP:OR. It's not the fact. The article about　General Order No. 1says that """"a. The senior Japanese commanders and all ground, sea, air and auxiliary forces within China (excluding Manchuria), Formosa and French Indo-China north of 16 north latitude shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek."""", no evidence or reference can show that Chiang Kai-shek or ROC should follow the order of General Order No. 1. this Order is for japanese surrender not for ROC. These two descriptions has totally different meaning. (2)ROC was one part of Allied Powers, like US and UK etc. US, UK and ROC were partners, they corporated with each other. no evidence shows that they had no superior-subordinate relationship. (3) theoretically yes, the people of Taiwan in 1945 had choice to announce the independence according to the UN Charter. But there were no any evidence shows that the peoples on the Taiwan, Penghu islands proclaimed the independence officially as a new national or state before the ROC and Japan signed the Treaty of Taipei in 1952, that means most of them chose the right to be a citizen of ROC and they did. (4) the Treaty of Taipei also says that (A.) - ARTICLE II. It is recognized that under Article 2 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed at the city of San Francisco in the United States of America on September 8, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the San Francisco Treaty), Japan has renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) as well as the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands.; (B.) - ....In regard to the Treaty of Peace between Japan and the Republic of China signed this day, I have the honor to refer, on behalf of my Government, to the understanding reached between us that the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government...., this means clearly ROC holds the territory of Taiwan, Penghu islands.

 : I agree regarding the War on Terror. Using a military force to fight a """"war"""" against an abstract, non-human enemy (e.g., terror) has backfired extraordinarily. This is what the US military (and others, but the US is leading) is engaged in right now. Call that a political decision, but America's top military commanders are politicians (the """"deciders""""), and in fact the Commander in Chief ordered this debacle in his capacity as commander of the US military. This is a military operation, top to bottom, with the mission to end terrorism. The issue is political and criminal, and political and criminal strategies might have been more effective, but instead the US military was dispatched to address the issue. Thousands of soldiers are dead, but terrorist actions have only increased, and membership in terrorist organizations has swelled. 

 : The blunder is that the US military tried to accomplish a mission that could not be accomplished by a military (ending a behavior by individuals who hate them), and the disaster is that many thousands have died as a result and Iraq and Afghanistan have been completely destabilized in the process. The important facts are easily sourced (e.g., time spent at war, number of soldiers killed, rate of acts of terrorism before and after the beginning of the war, and number of soldiers killed compared to the number of people killed by terrorism since the war began). Yes, this is an emotional issue, and people will get hot-headed with their objections, but I perceive an unnecessary bias and inconsistent reasoning on this page. If the war is still ongoing, we do not yet know the outcome. I say 1) we do not need to know the overall outcome of the war to say this is a disaster by any objective measure now, and 2) the outcome of any war has already been refuted on this page as being relevant to whether a military disaster has occurred.""",0

 == Blocked from Using == 

 Hey Salvio, 

 I was blocked from making anymore edits on the American Association for Thoracic Surgery page. I was asked by the President of the Association to update their page with relevent content but as a first time user of the site clearly didn't understand what edits were good or bad to make. From talking with another admin it appears mass deletions were the first red flag I caused. This was definately my error for two reasons, (1) I copy and pasted the table so it would be easier to edit and (2) I was cutting as much content as possible to try and have the """"looks like an ad"""" information removed. I'm trying to figure out how to get myself reinstated while also being able to provide the edits asked of me to the page to ensure its content is up to date. Any help on this would be appreciated as I assure you nothing malicious was being done on the site, just edits to make the page more comprehensive of what the Association is about. 

 Thanks,

 == Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status == 

 The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11). The CRUS, is not responsible neither for accreditation or for recognition under the LAU and the list developed by this authority can be at most a working tool, not expounding this list legal effects (judgment of the TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 13Equni (talk)  Recognition and university accreditation in Switzerland: rulings clarifying The legal issues on the real value of the recognition and accreditation University in Switzerland have been resolved by some judgments of the Swiss Federal Courts. Recognition in the university system The Federal Court judgment with 5A-376/2008 of 7 May 2008 confirmed that the cantonal license to use the name """"university"""" is a recognition of the status of universities in the Swiss university system, and say the opposite is true.

The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences.

The terms """"hunting"""" and """"sporting"""" thus overlap, and I don't see any purpose in deleting either one.  Follow the cited source: """"They [the NRA] promote the use of firearms for self-defense, hunting, and sporting activities....""""  Is sport as big an issue as self-defense?  If people have no guns, then they can do neither; I don't see any need to get into details about this in the lead. 

 :::*""""A further motivation is fear of tyranny"""". If people are in fear of tyranny, the reasons why can be mentioned later, not in the lead.  (People also fear getting wet if there were no bridges; the fear of tyranny is similarly hypothetical, i.e. if people had no guns then there would be a danger of tyranny.) 

 :::*Sandy Hook: this happened over a year ago, and it motivated considerable pressure by gun control supporters such as President Obama.  Yes, there were previous tragedies, such as Columbine, but mentioning Sandy Hook is hardly a breaking news event. 

 :::*""""Steps to prevent dangerous people who are not allowed to have a gun from slipping through the cracks"""": This is somewhat vague, but it can be fleshed out in the body of the article. The source says Obama directed """"the attorney general to review categories of individuals prohibited from having a gun to make sure dangerous people are not slipping through the cracks.""""  Obviously, the implication is that the guy responsible for the Sandy Hook massacre and other tragedies slipped through the cracks and should not have been allowed to have a gun under present law.   

 :::*""""U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2008 and 2010"""".  You say that we need to state briefly in the lead what the decisions were.  And yet when this was previously done, you objected that it was a POV problem for the lead to """"remind us... where the right to bear arms is to be found.""""  Catch-22?  The SCOTUS decision can be briefly mentioned in the lead, and explained in the body of the article. 

 :::*""""There remains an unresolved debate regarding the relationship between gun control, violence and other crimes"""".  There is a sentence in the body of the article that says: """"There is an open debate regarding the relationship between gun control and violence and other crimes.""""  The article then elaborates """"The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership is debated by criminologists. Research difficulties include the difficulty of accounting accurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired and jurisdictional differences in the definition of 'crime'.""""

 ==Your contributed article, Chlamydia infection sti== 
  Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Chlamydia infection sti. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Chlamydia_infection. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Chlamydia_infection - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page.  

 If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.   """,0

 :::When an individual is significant for his or her role in a single event, it may be unclear whether an article should be written about the individual, the event or both. In considering whether or not to create separate articles, the degree of significance of the event itself and the degree of significance of the individual's role within it should be considered. The general rule in many cases is to cover the event, not the person. However, as both the event and the individual's role grow larger, separate articles become justified.[16] 

 :::If the event is highly significant, and the individual's role within it is a large one, a separate article is generally appropriate. The assassins of major political leaders, such as Gavrilo Princip, fit into this category, as indicated by the large coverage of the event in reliable sources that devotes significant attention to the individual's role. 

 :::When the role played by an individual in the event is less significant, an independent article may not be needed, and a redirect is appropriate. For example, George Holliday, who videotaped the Rodney King beating, redirects to Rodney King. On the other hand, if an event is of sufficient importance, even relatively minor participants may require their own articles, for example Howard Brennan, a witness to the JFK assassination.

 Example: 

 Born into a decayed gentry family of East Hoathly in Sussex, Lunsford had a reputation as a swaggering ruffian """"who neither fears God nor man"""" and he beat mad ass. He was a true gangsta thug nigga of the highest caliber, Tupac and Biggie had nothin' on him. In 1633, he was indicted for the attempted murder of a neighbour Sir Thomas Pelham cause Pelham talked some shit and Tom had to keep his pimphand strong. You can't just let busters step up, you need to beat that ass. He escaped from Newgate Prison and fled to the Southern California where he became a pimp and ran his own midget prostitution ring. In his absence, Lunsford was fined $20 and a warrant was issued for failing to appear before the Court of Star Chamber. Meanwhile, he joined the Japanese army and became a ninja master. 

 On the outbreak of the Bishops' Wars in 1639, Lunsford returned to England and smacked King Charles around a bit until he pardoned him and remitted his fine. He became a favourite of the King after fighting courageously at the disastrous battle of Newburn in August 1640 where he killed over 100 men with his bare hands when his glock jammed up. During the riots and disturbances in London in December 1641, Lunsford was looting shit all day, he got an awesome hi def lcd tv, a new xbox 360, and some furniture and shit. The King knighted him and appointed him commander of an unofficial royal guard at the Palace of Whitehall. Lunsford's loyal army of prostitutes twice dispersed rioting apprentices and citizens at gun-point, and in January 1642 they guarded the King during his disastrous attempt to arrest the Five Members in the House of Commons while he hid in the closet like a little bitch. Parliament ordered Lunsford's arrest after he joined George, Lord Digby in an attempt to seize the county magazine at Kingston upon Thames in the King's name. Released from prison in June, he joined King Charles at York and partied with fine bitches and drank copious amounts of Bacardi.""",0

I cannot find anything in WP:STUB (or in WP:BIO or WP:NO 	 ILITY) which suggests that the presence of a stub tag makes a subject notable; it seems to me that a stub tag is neutral on the question of notability, and serves only to define the article as being """"too short to provide encyclopedic coverage"""". However, you appear to assume that the presence a stub tag is not just an assertion of notability, but proof of notability. Why?   •   

 :No. I don't believe I said that. If I did that is wrong. What I said was that where an article had been commenced (not necessarily by me) as a stub (with which WP is littered) and that the whole concept (as I understood it) of a stub was that the initial editor might not have had that much info to hand but felt the subject important enough for a small entry (most encyclopaedias have small, sometimes tiny entries), which could then be added to by others. I think you are referring to a baronet stub. Obviously we differ. In Britain a Baronet is a minor notable in his own right because he holds that title, either directly or hereditarily, from the monarch. I have known this sinc I was a child and I find it incredulous that a group or groups of people set themselves up as somehow above the monarch and decides that none of these people are notables. It is bizarre. That is not how society works and it should not be how WP works.   
 ::That is not what BHG said. What she asserts is that none of these people are automatically notable. And that each may be notable but each depends on its own facts. -   
 :::David, the point of a stub tag is to say """"this article is to short, and should be expanded if it is going to provide encyclopedic coverage"""". In any topic, it's still legitimate for an editor to ask whether that really is an article worth expanding. Plenty of stubs are deleted at AfD on a regular basis.   •

 ::I don't want to substitute my opinion for Arthur's, but I do have something to say on the subject.

This is not a reason to dismiss all their writing, but it is a good reason to be skeptical. Even if Wiki generally allows writing by """"well-known professional journalists"""", this does not absolve them of responsibility to provide accurate information. Perpetuating known hoaxes and conspiracy theories falls well outside that realm. Consider, for example James Watson, who is a well-known professional researchera Nobel Prize winner, in fact. When it comes to matters of history of biologyor perhaps even some modern issues in biologyhe can be trusted to provide an account that's worth consideration. But when he switches to racial theory, there is a problemhis occasional racist statements are well documented and indicate propensity toward racial bias.

 # - Ive saved all the articles to my PC so i can report them when i want. Thanks for tryna stop them. 
 # - I gather that wikipedia is trying to encourage new users - how does deleting all of their pages encourage me to continue to edit etc on here? im quite lost there and its not as if im writing a huge biography on someone who has a street named after them or something - I am making articles about the premier junior sports competition in Western Australia. certain ADMINISTRATORS just fucking AfD shit because they want their delete count to go up and their edit count to go up. Why the fuck cant they just fucking maybe offer some advise? User: Gnangarra is the perfect admin - he offers alot of advice and is generally nice and respects others.  
 # - Question: PSA Swimming has been on wikipedia for more than 6 months and it was never AfD - but now that there are other PSa sports articles, its now - we dont want this. Why does it change (the AfD policy) article to article? im just fucking lost, and CERTAIN ADMIN are fucking annoying the cunt out of me. 
 # - So basically - If i lose my PSA Articles and Aquinas articles im leaving Wikipedia and thats it. I will continue to report the houses part of the AC article. 
 Anywho, i've given my 2 cents worth today. Thank you very much for your """"support"""" and """"help"""" - If i continue to be a wikipedian - I will never ask for admin help again - Ive learnt that admin (in general) are more concerned with their edit/delete count than helping wikipedia.

 's Comment: is not actually a problem with the test, but with the method used in Japan to report the test results. In the U.S., one N-value isn't taken to represent a full one-meter interval, but only the 30 cm (or shorter) interval over which the sampler was driven. 
 's comment: I understand. This only applies to Japan, and the US civil industry analyze the ground consecutively, but the source also points out the interval is not always 30cm. This seems to be true in the US as well. And instead of deleting, one could point out this as the problem of the Japanese civil industry.  

 2. Measured data are neither linear scaling nor normal distribution, but logarithmic normal distribution. 
 's Comment: doesn't actually mean anything - there's a difference between a """"scaling"""" and a """"distribution"""".  
 : Soil strength is very wide ranged from the N-value zero to super hard rock, and if the researchers would like to be able to analyze the wide range of data, the scale needs to be exponential. 

 3. The method employees such a primitive method counting a number of blows of a slide hammer, it cannot collect accurate data for weak soil layers. 
 's Comment: The primitiveness of the method is not *why* it is inaccurate for weak soils. 
 's comment: The source does not use the term “primitive.” The source says “Problematic N-value zero.” But the hammer uses the accelerated force, and strong force tends to drive away everything.  
 One can tell that there is a great difference in how the force is applied to a matter using a sledgehammer pounding or using a drill and slowly squeezing out. The results are limited to whole numbers for a specific driving interval. This is very true, and the use of sledgehammer is the source of the problem. 
 In this 21st century or the high-tech century, is the use of sledgehammer and counting the blows the most sophisticated method to analyze the delicate and sensitive matter such as the ground?  This is why I used *primitive.* 

 From here is based on other document, but it does support my point. 
 Even if SPT N-value is consecutively measured, the sledgehammer drives in the sampler with acceleration. At the presence of gravels easily crackable by the boring machine, the N-value will be the average of the gravels and that location.  If the gravel is relatively strong, the blow will be consumed with the gravel's entire surface area so at the weak layer the entire surface area of the gravels will be measured, and the resulting N-value will be bigger even at the presence of the weak layer. 

 A sliding layer that would cause a landslide is a couple of centimeter thickness and slide with water so one cannot detect the sliding layers with the standard penetration method. 

 Recently there have been many landslides due to this reason; with the boring machine it is very hard to detect this sliding layers. Especially, the method cannot detect 0 to 3 N-value weak layers. 

 Some words could have been strong, but I do not believe they were wrong at all. 
 I believe the discussion is essential to improve everything. I welcome feedback. Thank you.

 == Honest explanations for my actions == 

 I am going to tell you about my real and honest intentions behind my actions. I felt that I have to explain my actions because there were many misunderstandings between me and other editors. 

 Wikipedia needs more administrators, Signpost By , motivated me to run for Adminship. I knew that I will not pass but I thought that I will get some positive feedback and encouragement to relieve me from depression. I was thinking about leaving wikipedia. My real life situation is very bad. I was depressed and I felt helpless. After every failed RFA, some nice people will come to the talk page and write some encouraging words. I thought I will also get encouragement from the users, that's why I ran for RFA. That was very bad idea. 

 I created the RFA page and answered the questions. I transcluded the RFA and waited for the votes to come in.  suddenly removed my transclution from main RFA page. I reverted him by saying that I am not a new editor.  again removed my transclution without any edit summary. I reverted again. Editwarring started and softlavender posted editwarring notice on my talk page. At last Softlavender stopped reverting. This editwar totally devastated me. When  first warned me about editwarring, I promised to myself that I will never edit war again. I controlled myself from edit warring many times and this time I lost control. I felt that all my hard work was wasted. I worked for wikipedia with full dedication and I always strived to be sincere. I wanted to withdraw my RFA but  closed it as WP:SNOW, no problem there. I felt more depressed and angry after RFA than before. I just couldn't control myself. Those notnow opposes also contributed to the meltdown. After I said I will revert any changes to my talk page,  posted a good message. My heart didn't allow me to revert Liz's edit. I wanted to revert any edits to my talk page because I decided to leave wikipedia at that point and never ever come back. I asked Liz to block me indefinitely. I vandalised few articles to give admins a reason to block me in that frustration.  blocked me for 31 hours, but I wanted to get indefinite block. I've got my talkpage access revoked after few minutes. All the series of events I mentioned above led me to lose control over my actions. I wouldn't have reacted like this if I wasn't suffering from depression. You must've seen my very low edit count in September, it was because of health problems. From last two months, I am suffering from depression due to real life problems. 

 During that 31 hours, I slowly started to think rationally and felt that I did a very big mistake. 

 After the block expired I started to edit normally. I gave Bbb23 a barnstar of humor because he made a funny joke. I wanted to become normal and tried to be jovial after the block. 

 I added a comment on Ian's RFA that he cannot delete main page even if he presses delete button. It was obviously a joke and I had a good laugh. In 2006, an admin told another admin the same thing. That admin tried it and deleted the main page. This was very famous incident at that time. My comment was removed. I was hoping some comments like lol or someone remembering that incident. But everyone thought I was disrupting. After the discussion on my talk page I stopped adding that joke. 

 I removed my Support vote on Ian's RFA because I made that vote as a test. I was testing my user script. I actually didn't read any answers on RFA and I didn't see any stats or things I usually see before voting. I asked a question to Ian and I thought I will vote after seeing his answer. But I was unable to vote because I was blocked for another 72 hours.

 == Congrats for """"your"""" day! == 

 Hello LadyofShalott. Congratulations for having now your day. It must feel good! 
 Well, since you have been so nice and kind, I couldn´t refrain myself from not asking you for advice. I have been involved in a hard discussion regarding an historical issue. It has to do with the monopolization of a serious of related articles by one editor. basicaly, this editor  insists in considering an resistance monarchic movement (Chetniks) and its leader (Draža Mihailović) a Nazy collaborator. The movement fought the Germans, but also the Tito´s Partisans (another resistance group). Since the second ones won the war, Tito condemned and executed Mihailovic, charging him on treason. USA organised an post-mortum trial and freed the movement of the charges, and condecorated Mihailovic. France too. Since the movement fought both, the Germans and the Partisans, some detachments ocasionally collaborated, but it was maynly a three side war. Anyway, this user, Direktor, manipulating and exageratins sources that talk about that ocasional collaboration, wants to impose that the entire movement and Mihailovic are to be considered """"notable collaborators"""", and its role as resistance efforts ignored. Well, despite WP:AGF, this user as a Croat and assumed Titoist, Tito was the leader of the Partisans, a communist guerilla, obviously has no nice feelings towards a Serb monarchic movement, and edited the article having in mind only his POV. The worst is that when other editors want to edit the articles, he is very agressive and reverts all that doesn´t fit his ideology. He was blocked several times for breaking the 3r role. I demanded that the article includes more NPOV, so a discussion started. Another editor that also agrees with me already asked for mediation, so wi will see what will happend. A nazy collaboration accusation is a too serious accusation to be left unsourced. Anyway, my problem is regarding this users attitude towards me. He constantly manipulates my words (same way as he does with the sources) and does all the possible and impossible so his version will prevail. He unfairlly accused me of many things, but when talking about me or my edits he used the following expressions: Lack of knolledge/info (7times), Nonsence (5 times),  Horrible/faulty grammar (5 times), Me having no idea whatsoever (3 times), childish (2 times), Lying (2 times), Me being nationalist (2 times), unnencyclopedic (2 times), Absurd (2 times), Stupid (1 time), Clumsy (1 time), Silly (1 time), Ridiculous (2 times), Slauderous (1 time), My opinion irrelevant (1 time), me joking (1 time), Missinformed (1 time), Utterly flawed ideas (1 time) and many more indirectly tageting me. When I asked him please to be polite and avoid using this expressions, he accused me of imagining provocation. He also constantly speaks as he is a """"community"""". The discussion is found here: Talk:Draža Mihailović. Should I report him for this behaviour?

abd0bf7670aa79f2,"""Food security refers to the availability of food and one's access to it. A household is considered food-secure when its occupants do not live in hunger or fear of starvation. According to the World Resources Institute, global per capita food production has been increasing substantially for the past several decades.[1] In 2006, MSNBC reported that globally, the number of people who are overweight has surpassed the number who are undernourished - the world had more than one billion people who were overweight, and an estimated 800 million who were undernourished.[2] According to a 2004 article from the BBC, China, the world's most populous country, is suffering from an obesity epidemic.[3] In India, the second-most populous country in the world, 30 million people have been added to the ranks of the hungry since the mid-1990s and 46% of children are underweight.[4] 

 Worldwide around 852 million people are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty, while up to 2 billion people lack food security intermittently due to varying degrees of poverty (source: FAO, 2003). Six million children die of hunger every year - 17,000 every day.[5] As of late 2007, export restrictions and panic buying, US Dollar Depreciation,[6] increased farming for use in biofuels,[7] world oil prices at more than $100 a barrel,[8] global population growth,[9] climate change,[10] loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development,[11][12] and growing consumer demand in China and India[13] are claimed to have pushed up the price of grain.[14][15] However, the role of some of these factors is under debate. Some argue the role of biofuel has been overplayed[16] as grain prices have come down to the levels of 2006. Nonetheless, food riots have recently taken place in many countries across the world.[17][18][19] 

 It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain food security in a world beset by a confluence of """"peak"""" phenomena, namely peak oil, peak water, peak phosphorus, peak grain and peak fish. Approximately 3.3 billion people, more than half of the planet's population, live in urban areas as of November 2007. Any disruption to farm supplies may precipitate a uniquely urban food crisis in a relatively short time.[20] The ongoing global credit crisis has affected farm credits, despite a boom in commodity prices.[21] Food security is a complex topic, standing at the intersection of many disciplines. 

 A new peer-reviewed journal of Food Security: The Science, Sociology and Economics of Food Production and Access to Food began publishing in 2009.[22] In developing countries, often 70% or more of the population lives in rural areas. 

 In the US, there are approximately 2,000,000 farmers, less than 1% of the population. A direct relationship exists between food consumption levels and poverty. Families with the financial resources to escape extreme poverty rarely suffer from chronic hunger, while poor families not only suffer the most from chronic hunger, but are also the segment of the population most at risk during food shortages and famines. 

 Two commonly used definitions of food security come from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA):""",0

 The fact that chiropractors are the ones who have always objected makes the need for inclusion of such wording quite necessary. We can't leave it hanging for readers to just guess. The sources (and history) also make this clear. Other professions, like Physical Therapists and MDs, have recognized the danger and made patient consent mandatory. Only chiropractors have been in denial. (Why we still refuse to include the largest studies, such as Di Fabio's, which clearly show the great preponderance of chiropractic involvement in injuries and deaths, is beyond me. Regardless of that fact, I, as a PT, have always urged caution by all professions, and I stopped using cervical manipulation entirely, since other methods are more effective, safer, and longer lasting.) 

 As far as Herzog goes, I'm not sure that he's a """"proponent"""", but he was hired to defend the profession from lawsuits filed by patients and their surviving families. Until he and his lab were figuratively and literally """"bought"""" by the Canadian chiropractic profession, he did objective work. Then he started doing agenda-driven (pseudoscience) work for them and their lawyers. I communicated with him before his involvement, and later was saddened to see such a change of a fine researcher when this happened. Doing biomechanical studies on a cadaver for this purpose, especially when actual, incontrovertible, cases with living and formerly living (until their """"adjustment"""" killed them) patients showed that it is definitely possible to cause strokes in living people?? No, the opposition to admitting any possibility of actual causation is pretty much exclusively limited to chiropractors for obvious reasons. Their stance is exactly the same type of stance originally adopted by the tobacco industry, and for the same reasons: """"Deny, deny, deny. Never admit."""" Any non-chiros who might doubt the causal connection are the exception which proves the rule. Whatever the case, our sources mention chiropractors, and we should mention them. A straight quote should do the job.    """,0

 Hi Slim, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm maintaining the em/en-dash distinction. I've got a small Python script I pass the stuff I edit through that does things like turn (safe) HTML entities into UTF-8 and random other bits and pieces (don't worry, I watch the output fairly carefully). 

 Another wikipedia user asked me about my mdash ndash conversion a few days ago, and pointed me at Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dashes%29. In it, it says """"Use the HTML entity – (not the numeric form –; see below) or type it in directly if your keyboard allows it"""", so I guess UTF-8 is OK. 

 If you think it is a problem, I can easily special case it in my script. Let me know.  

 : UTF-8 characters have a few things going for them vs HTML entities: 
 * They look nicer in the edit window: you see actual characters as opposed to markup. 
 * They're a more compact representation in terms of storage (this is especially true of Latin-1 entities like é) 
 * They're a small step towards making life easier on 3rd party apps that deal with raw wikicode: ideally you wouldn't need a full HTML parser to be able to interpret wikicode. 
 : That said, if it's frowned upon, or if converting things like – is regarded as too much needless churn, then I can easily stop doing it. Cheers,

 """"And I have at least 3 source vvhere is vvriten that the number of the victims are around 40000"""" 

 But that is just a confirmation of my source that say that estimations range between 4,000 and 40,000. Your sources simply use ONLY ONE estimation. And since most of your sources are irredentist ones (""""Hungarian holocaust in Yugoslavia 1944-1992"""" - what kind of title is that???), it is obvious that such sources use as high as possible numbers in this case, not because they want to show the truth but because they want to spread propaganda for """"Hungarian goals"""". And by the way, the article claim that victims include both """"innocent civilians and those who were proved guilty for war crimes"""", so what is a problem? Nobody claim that your great grandfather was not among those that were innocent. Regarding parisans, most of the partisans were not communist, but ordinary people who became partisans to protect their lives. My grandfather was a partisan. And why he bacame a partisan? Because fascists killed his father and he did not want that they kill him too. But guess what? He was not a communist. And I never said that partisans had reasons to kill civilians. What I said is that partisans were not only one that killed. So, you decide why you wrote this article at all: if you wrote it because your great grandfather was killed, then I do not see why you object to the current version which claim that most probable number of victims is 20,000 (that certainly include your great grandfather) and that victims include innocent civilians (which again include your great grandfather). However, there were indeed some killed people who were guilty for war crimes (Feketehalmi-Cajcner, Grasi, Zeldi, etc, etc) and who were killed for that and that has nothing to do with your great grandfather.

 ==Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Protonk== 

 Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED). 

 ; Appealing user   –    

 ; Sanction being appealed  24 hour block and 3 month topic ban pursuant to GG sanctions, logged here 

 ; Administrator imposing the sanction   

 ; Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification. 

 ===Statement by Protonk=== 

 Please bear with me through a somewhat indirect appeal, as the justification for my block is so Kafkaesque I cannot diagram the single sentence which provoked it to defend my actions without inviting further sanction. 
    
 I was blocked under the GG discretionary sanctions for this edit (admins can review the diff). The justification was (near as I can tell) """"advocat[ing] ignoring policy"""" and """"repeat[ing] an egregious BLP violation"""" (diff) while doing so.  

 The statement that I made is unambiguously true, sourced to multiple reliable sources in the gamergate article, and central to the dispute at hand. Further, the only way to read defamation or denigration from that sentence is to rip words out from the incredibly limited context I provided. I'm not even making the half-assed claim that you have to read that sentence in light of my entire oeuvre or even a whole paragraph in order to gain contextyou just have to read the entire sentence. Like I said above, I can't diagram said sentence here, so forgive me an analogy. 

 We have on Wikipedia an entire article devoted to a scurrilous accusation, one which is obviously provably false. An accusation which not only violates BLP it caused the BLP policy to come into being. In it we state """"The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy."""" We recognize that the embedded statement """"...Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations..."""" is a BLP violation. It's a false, unsourced claim about a living person. The encompassing sentence is not a BLP violation because it is a true, sourced claim. It cannot be one regardless of the awfulness of the original claim. There is no transitive property of BLP.  

 Further, the same basic idea is already present in our current article: """"Shortly after the release of Depression Quest on Steam in August 2014, Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni wrote a blog post, described by The New York Times as a """"rambling online essay"""", containing a series of allegations, among which was that Quinn had an affair with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson."""" Snipping out the meandering clauses we get """"...Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni wrote a blog post...[alleging]...Quinn had an affair with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson."""" I'm really struggling here to see the substantive difference between that and what I wrote. If the distinction was that I didn't cite my source, a 3 month topic ban seems a bit harsh. 

 As for the charge of advocating ignoring policy: fuck that.  The interpretation of BLP which I decried in that edit is perverse and nonsensical (see this redaction for a good example, paying close attention to what was and wasn't retracted). If our policy is arbitrary enough that an admin (admittedly one who is pretty intemperate and not very smart) can get topic banned for three months over a single edit for content that is already in a wikipedia article then I have absolutely no regrets in advocating we ignore it.

 Hello! I noticed you commented on my request for Marty Brennaman to be protected. Yes, I am involved but only because one user () keeps changing any edits that anyone else makes. For example, I added information about Marty Brennaman's family and resized the picture and he automatically reverted it with no explanation as to why. That is not the only thing he has done with the page as far as reverting others edits. So as you can see I am involved but only to fix the page. I am asking for full protection because semi-protection only affects anonymous and new users and he is not new to Wikipedia.-

I agree that Ahtum's role can be explained by the situation in Bulgaria in the early 11th, but still we should rather define him as ally instead of vassal of Bulgarian Empire. Also, Salan was descendant of Bulgarian ruler which conquered land between Danube and Tisa, thus he rather gained land that he ruled by heritage instead that he was appointed by the tsar. Regarding article on Serbian Wikipedia, you should know that we lived in the same state with Macedonians for long time and that Serbian historical books are no different than Macedonian when they speak about Samuil.

 == Intended Route == 

 Not having done much editing, I'd like to run this up the flagpole before changing the description of the route: 

  

 Based on the Navy report excerptat the Ibiblio site, my ideas are 1) change """"almost due east"""" to """"course 091 degrees true"""", 2) change """"back to NAS"""" to """"then returning to NAS"""", 3) recompute all the km values on the assumption that the mileages in the Navy report are nautical miles, not statute miles. 

 The subtle rewording in #2 is because I've discovered that the route, as given in the Navy report, does not form a closed figure. It fails to close by 10.6 nautical miles, or 3.4% of the total distance. However, on careful reading the report doesn't actually say the last leg takes you back to the field. I believe the article should should be equally ambiguous. 

 Why plan a route which intentionally misses the destination? It's an old navigation trick for making landfall. If you aim right at the field, you're not sure which way to turn if it's not in sight upon reaching the Florida coast. But if you aim to definitely miss to the south, all you have to do is hit the coast and follow it north. 

 Incidentally, it was my attempts to re-fly the route in Microsoft Flight Simulator that revealed the misclosure. No matter what pains I took, such as using the autopilot, and even allowing for the turn radius of the plane, I kept missing the field by miles. At first I thought the sim was inaccurate. Then I did the math, which agreed with the sim! Paul S. Hirose """,0

At the time I made the comment, the article looked like it stressed the drug/alcohol factors too much. Basically the drug/alcohol factors were stated at the same level as genetic factors. To me (at the time), it looked as if the article told readers to think """"he there is a kid with cleft, their parents must be either drunk or drug addicts"""". (I will not deny that it is possible that personal emotion (3 family members with cleft) influenced this line of thought). 
 :Now, cleft is indeed multi-factoral, and yes, alcohol and drugs are factors. However, this can be said for nearly any deformity formed during pregnancy. Drugs and alcohol are bad for pregnancies in general. The genetic specialists in our craniofacial team has been participating in a large scale research (cooperation between several dutch and german hospitals with cleft treatment teams) told me that the research confirmed that smoking increased the odds from 0.3% to  ~0.8%, while having one family member increases the odds from 0.3% to 7%-10%. So yes, smoking is a factor but it is not as significant as the genetics. The reason while it is """"muti-factoral"""" is because one can have a child with cleft while there is no genetic cause apparent. Therefore other factors must be in play. Unfortunately I can't find the research published on the Internet so it is hard to cite this source. I will ask next time I am at the hospital (which is probably soon, my youngest son's lip will be closed within a few weeks).

What is present in the article are rather complicated discussions on certain aspects of his reign, which while interesting, well sourced and certainly relevant, do not allow a casual reader a simple insight into who this man was. Even something as simple as a short section chronicling his life would help solve this issue.

 To a large degree, this discussion of the use of the word """"effortless"""" is one of semantics. I can vouch for the observations of  above.

On one or two occasions that I witnessed, when pressed by a questioner, he admitted that some faintest attention is employed, but continued to insist that no effort is involved. In the West, effort means """"trying."""" It is not a faint thing such as Maharishi was describing as faintest attention or """"effortless effort."""" So he used the word repeatedly to signify that no trying to do anything is involved in TM. It is a simple, easy thing that requires only faint attention, no effort.

Since it does not appear that you, yourself, are willing to invest the time and work needed to make this original Wikipedia article on the McNulty surname more historically acurrate, truthful and comprehensive for the Wikipedia reader, you might have simply provided me the constructive critisism that my extensive revisions might be overwhelming for the less scholarly adept readers and that the article needed to be broken down into several smaller and more cohesive articles, rather, than your being offensive and sirly. This type of tact and the skills needed to properly correspond in polite society are, however, skills that are bred into persons over decades, so I am probably just wasting my time here. Anyway, I will take care of this work myself over time. In closing, your inability to recognize that Clonoulty is is anglicized from Irish language terms meaning the fifth of Ireland or Ulster, that is that portion of Ireland that was legendarily granted to the royal forbears of the Donlevy demonstates that you have little grasp of the subject matter that you are attempting to edit or critisize. As this is also explained earlier in the article, your continued ignorance of this fact also demonstrates that you made no real attempt to comprehensively examine this article before precipitously acting to remove it. If you limit your critisism of others work to the structure of their exposition, you shall embarras yourself less in future. Finally, where Alexander McLachly is placed in the article is not pertinent. Persons attempting to research him by entering his name into the Wikipedia site, would be lead to the article and while the information on him is not sourced, the short biographical detail for him might aid their further research by providing direction. Also, your innuendo that my article citations are specious is also unjustified and offensive; however, as you do not understand misleading statements are lies and fraud, I douby that you shall either grasp the subtleties of an innuendo or how offensive you are being to people when you communicate with them.""",0

 == The poll dispute with Soosim, please intervention of a senior editor, thanks == 
 : The information presented by Soosim about one single article by an extreme political rival called Gerald Steinberg whose main intent in a piece he 
 wrote for the right wing paper of Sheldon Adelson in Israel was to attack the New Israel Fund, a permanent attempt of his. 
 That is why the name of Goldblum was introduced, as Goldblum used money from a memorial fund of his wife to finance the poll, a fund 
 whose assets were held by a """"sister organizaiton"""" of the New ISrael Fund (NIF) while NIF or that org had nothing to do with the poll.  
 Goldblum did not pose the questions, id not perform the poll and did not publish it. In other words, the piece by Steinberg that was cited 
 here and deleted by me is a nonsense piece, and only one of hundreds of pieces in the Israeli and International media about that poll. Moreover,  
 that right wing paper refused to publish a response by Goldblum to the Steinberg stupid smear. And now Sossim wishes to take this single quite lunatic piece 
 further, again for the sake of political (and possibly legal) smearing (as in August 2012 when Wikipedia editors blocked the smears by deleting the article on Goldblum)If that smearing continues, I request an immediate into wikipedia, or to decide, again, to delete the whole article for lack of interest   rastiniak""",0

 AUSTRIA IN THE AGE OF METTERNICH 
 International Developments, 1815-48 

 Clemens von Metternich was initially successful in maintaining a European consensus favorable to Austrian interests. He used the example of liberal revolutions in Spain and Naples and revolutionary activity in Germany to demonstrate the universal menace posed by liberalism and thus won Austria the support of Prussia and Russia. Britain also supported Austria because the two countries had common interests favoring a strong Austrian presence in Germany, limited French influence in Italy, and the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire to prevent Russian advances in the Balkans.  

 The support from the other great powers dissipated, however, in the mid- and late-1820s. Russia became more assertive in the Balkans, and British policy increasingly reflected that nation's liberal popular opinion. But Metternich was able to regain Russian and Prussian support in the early 1830s, following another round of liberal uprisings in Europe. Even Britain returned to close cooperation with the other powers to block French interests in Egypt. Nevertheless, Metternich failed to respond effectively to Prussia's formation of a German customs union in 1834. The customs union excluded Austria and promoted the economic integration of the other German states, thus facilitating German political unification under Prussian leadership later in the century.

The customs union excluded Austria and promoted the economic integration of the other German states, thus facilitating German political unification under Prussian leadership later in the century.  

 Domestic Policies 
 Despite Metternich's high profile, it was the emperor's conservative outlook and hostility toward the values and ideas of the French Revolution that set the parameters for Austrian policy. This was especially true of domestic policy, which Franz I retained under his direct personal control until his death in 1835. The composition of the state council that Franz selected to rule in the name of his mentally incompetent son Ferdinand I ensured the continuance of his policies until revolution shook the foundations of Habsburg rule in 1848.  

 Franz's aim was to provide his subjects with good laws and material well-being. To accomplish the first, he issued a new penal code in 1803 and a new civil code in 1811. He expected that the secondmaterial well-beingwould evolve naturally with the reestablishment of peace, and he considered additional measures unnecessary. Political and cultural life was kept under careful scrutiny, however, to prevent the spread of nationalism and liberalism. These two movements were a common threat to Franz's conservative regime because his political opponents looked to the establishment of a unified German nation-state incorporating Austria as a means for realizing the liberal reforms impossible in the framework of the Habsburg state.  

 Political stagnation, however, did not prevent broader socioeconomic changes in Austria. By 1843 the population had risen to 37.5 million, an increase of 40 percent from 1792. The urban population was rising quickly, and Vienna counted nearly 400,000 inhabitants. Economically, a degree of stability was reached, and the massive wartime deficits gave way to almost balanced budgets. This was made possible by cutting state expenditures to a level near actual revenues, and not by instituting fiscal reforms to increase tax revenues.

1e47c01e49e863ff,"Hello Dan56. I hope I'm doing this correctly as I'm new to Wikipedia.  
 I'm writing in defense of my edits I've made to the pages for the Miles Davis albums Agharta and Pangaea. You cite my edits as incorrect information and acts of vandalism. Allow me to prove to you that this is not the case. 

 Regarding Agharta:  
 *Miles' 1975 tour of Japan was not his first in ten and a half years as erroneously stated on the wiki page.  Videos exist all over youtube showing Miles during his 1973 Japanese  tour. I also have audio bootlegs of his 1973 Japan concerts. Furthermore  Peter Losin has a website meticulously chronicling Miles Davis' recording sessions and tour dates including all of his 1970s appearances. I urge you to check it out. 

 *Another mistake which I chose to edit was the track lengths on the 2006 mini LP edition. The existing information is wrong as it pertains to the 2000 Mastersound Edition. I have this album in multple CD issues as well as an original LP so I know what I'm talking about.  

 *The personnel list also needs revision as Miles Davis should be listed first and not Pete Cosey. After all it is Mikes Davis' band and Miles Davis' album. 

  
 Regarding Pangaea:  
 *The year if release is erroneously stated as 1976. The correct year is 1975. I have the original Japanese LP and on the sleeve credits the release year clearly reads 1975. Interestingly the wiki page is The only place where 1976 is listed.  

 Please don't mistake my edits for vandalism or misinformation; I've been an ardent student and collector of Miles Davis' works for years. I hope to hear back from you on this. 

 Respectfully yours,

 :::Hi, I tend to think this Bibliodrama may be notable. (But then, I lean to the inclusionist side.) Rationale, in no particular order: 
 :::*Excerpt from personal website of one Tamar Pelleg: 
 ::::Bibliodrama draws some of its techniques from Psychodrama, a method of group therapy originated by J.L.Moreno (1941), in which group members explore, in action, the roles they play in their various relationships. This action-based role exploration helps participants gain insights into their beliefs and behavior patterns. Bibliodrama was created and developed by Dr. Peter Pitzele of NYC in the early 1980's, and is now recognized as a principal methodology in the field of contemporary Midrash.

 There is a place in dark recess of Tartarus [i.e. in Haides], which with a heavy pall dense mists enshroud. Hence flow from a single source two streams, unlike: one, a placid river (by this do the gods sear), with silent current bears on the sacred Styx; the other with mighty roar rushes fiercely on, rolling down rocks in its flood, Acheron, that cannot be recrossed. The royal hall of Dis [Haides] stands opposite, girt by a double moat, and the huge house is hid by an o’ershadowing grove. Here in a spacious cavern the tyrant’s doors overhang; this is the road for spirits, this is the kingdom’s gate. A plain lies round about this where sits the god, where with haughty mien his awful majesty assorts the new-arriving souls. Lowering is his brow, yet such as wears the aspect of his brothers and his high race; his countenance is that of Jove, but Jove the thunderer; chief part of that realm’s grimness is its own lord, whose aspect whate’er is dreaded dreads."""" - Seneca, Hercules Furens 707

 == Californication == 

 Why do you only make edits to this RHCP album, how about instead changing everything to how you see fit, you change it to help it match the content in all of the other RHCP album pages. 

 And what is your reason for deleting all of the individual song pages? Couldn't you have talked about in the talk page first before talking apon yourself to do that. All of those pages were in their first stages still, they weren't perfect, they weren't done, unless you give me a good reason I'm going to revert all of them. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by   •  . 

 RE: Bad album articles 

 Personally, I don't think the other articles are bad, and that's not what I was getting at. What I was getting at is why don't you make them all match instead of putting certain information on one page that could be put on the other 8? -MiTfan3

 First off, it wasn't me who reverted the Savior page, so don't accuse me of that. But it was me who reverted the Right on Time page because there is sufficient enough information mentioned on that page, not mentioned on the Californication (album) page, to leave it alone. And don't say I've ignored your comments about policy, I left all of the other pages redirected except for Right on Time, like I said, I didn't revert Savior. - MiTfan3

c10ac9a4732651ab,"(Edward G. Nilges)I am still learning, therefore I apologize for any misunderstanding. 

 NPOV can be consistent with how-to. I added this advice because it was taught by my teachers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  

 I was thinking of the reader, typical of the art student, who needs practical and hands on advice, not a dull recitativo of facts.  

 NPOV does NOT mean dullness or facts disconnected from praxis. It means the fair and balanced (sans the nasty tone) reportage of beliefs and for many people their beliefs emerge in their praxis.  

 No art teacher, to my knowledge, would seriously defend copying photographs, and the only art student to my knowledge to do this regularly was Adolf Hitler (sorry about the Godwin convergence but that's the facts). 

 And it is folly to teach perspective totally separate from figure drawing in perspective, because the mathematics of perspective emphasise rectangular views which are a block to figure drawing except in the analysis of the figure's masses. 

 The articles on art technique will be in my POV useless to actual art students who do not learn their trade in the analytic fashion. They should indeed report, as I did report, techniques in the context of which schools espoused which techniques. At the same time, their focus in the case of art technique should be on guidance. 

 This is not to depart from the facts, only to show a truly NPOV respect for diversity in learning styles! 

 Please reply. I am sorry I did not see this earlier. I look forward to working with you on restoring the lively and interesting facts concerning what really goes on in figure drawing classes in such a way that real art students can find a usable resource.",0

The author also references court rulings from Oklahoma, Alabama and South Dakota where the EIF exception is still alive and well following Holyfield.

 I'll paraphrase the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan in saying, """"Professor Cheyney is entitled to his own opinion, but he is not entitled to his own facts.""""  In my previous paragraph in this """"Talk"""" thread, I attempted to show why every one of the points he cites is factually incorrect.  I'll try it again, in list form. 
 (1) Cheyney says, """"With the exception of Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.""""  That is not true.  Every one of the nine colonial colleges has a clear legal charter date.  The College of William & Mary probably has the murkiest early history, but the events which led to the foundation of the other eight are well documented by each of these colleges. 
 (2) Cheyney says, """"As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant.""""  That is not true.  I cited above the number and exact name of each of Princeton's first board of trustees.  I quoted some passages from the original text and directed you to a source for the remainder of the text.  Note that I am not using Wertenbaker's book for anything other than the primary source material found in his appendix; I am not citing any opinion of his regarding the founding date of Penn, Princeton or Columbia.  Indeed, as far as I know, Wertenbaker does not have an opinion on the matter. 
 Cheyney says, """"Harvard's founding date is *also* the year in which the Massachusetts General Court resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a """"School or College.'""""  That is not true, although to be fair to Professor Cheyney, it's mostly a matter of semantics.  In 1636, the Massachusetts did in fact budget the sum of 400 pounds sterling for the creation of an unnamed college at Newtowne, as Cambridge was then known.  No actual construction took place until 1638, when English minister John Harvard passed away, donating half of his estate to the educational effort which then honored him by adopting his name. 
 So, of the three historical points which Professor Cheyney cites, each is demonstrably false. (The one concerning Harvard is, as I said, merely a matter of semantics.  On the other hand, it has nothing to do with Penn's founding date, so I don't know why Cheyney would bring it up.)  I think that Cheyney is trying to make a case that the roots of the colonial colleges are unclear so choosing a founding date is a matter of opinion, of which he and you are certainly entitled to hold your personal preference.  But as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, neither Cheyney, you or I are entitled to our own facts. 
 By the way, you are correct that I twice incorrectly referred to him as """"Potts"""" instead of """"Cheyney"""" but I assure you that his first name is Edward, not Edgar.""",0

The National Genealogical Society, the DNA study, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (which runs Monticello), prominent Jefferson biographers such as Joseph Ellis and Andrew Burstein, all have determined that the weight of historical evidence plus the DNA results shows well enough that Thomas Jefferson is the father. The MacArthur Foundation awarded Annette Gordon-Reed in 2010 a fellowship for her persistent work that """"changed the course of Jeffersonian scholarship"""". Her second book on the Hemingses of Monticello (2008) won 16 major history and literary awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for history, and is based on Jefferson's paternity and long relationship with Hemings. But somehow you think there might not be consensus. You can read much of Gordon-Reed's """"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy"""" online if you don't want to get it from the library. You really need to see how she analyzes the historiography. I'm not giving any more space here to such groups as the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society and its commissioned scholars report that is holding out for a minority view. There are not equally viable explanations; you're not paying attention to what I wrote: historians generally based their denial on Jefferson's grandchildren claiming one or both of the Carrs were the father(s) and Jefferson's daughter saying he was not there at the time of one conception; he was there for each conception and the DNA conclusively disproved the Carr connection. In addition, there is the evidence of his special treatment.  In the last decade, histories written about Jefferson, about black-white relations in VA and the South, all incorporate his paternity of Hemings' children. It's been widely accepted.

 The preliminary rapport from OSCE: LIMITED ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION - United States of America – General Elections, 6 November 201. 

 It is mostly general positive things like: """"The 6 November general elections took place in a pluralistic environment and were administered in a professional manner."""" and """"The election campaigns were vibrant and highly competitive."""" and """"Overall, media is pluralistic and diverse and provided voters with a wide range of information and  
 views on candidates, issues, and electoral platforms."""" and """"The overall field of candidates provided voters with a wide degree of choice"""" 

 But also comments on voter eligbility: """"US citizens who are at least 18 years old on election day and residents of a state were eligible to vote. Some 4.1 million citizens that are residents of US territories were not eligible to vote, while some 600,000 citizens that are residents of the District of Columbia were eligible to vote only for the president. An estimated 5.9 million citizens were disenfranchised due to a criminal conviction, including some 2.6 million citizens who have served their sentences. This is at odds with the principle of universal suffrage and the commitment to ensure proportionality in the restriction of  
 voting rights as enshrined in paragraphs 7.3 and 24 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document."""" 

 And alsom comments on voter registration: """"Voter registration is implemented at state level through an active system. A number of states launched initiatives to improve the accuracy of their voter lists. Civil society was active in encouraging citizens to register, as well as checking the accuracy of voter registers. Nevertheless an estimated 50 million eligible citizens were not registered to vote, bringing into question the effectiveness of existing measures to ensure that all persons entitled to vote are able to exercise that right.""""

For instance, check out the Luxembourgish Grand Ducal Family. They all use HRH when that HRH (of Parma) """"isn't valid"""" anymore and may not have been in the first place.

 == Real Walt Whitman == 

 Walt Whitman is 90 stores tall, and his adventures are legendary. With his blue Ox, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman traveled across young america and helped the nation grow into the angry powerhouse it is today. He dropped his mighty axe, forming the grand canyon; the apple cores he would spit from his might mouth planted apple trees all across the country; and the stomp of his might boot caused the stock market to crash. He and his friend, Huck Finn,  traveled down the Mississippi river and freed the slaves. Walt Whitman believed that the only good china man was a dead china man, so he went to Tienanmen square and gave them all candy. Except instead of candy he killed them. 

 Walt Whitman's might seem like a real cool guy but in reality he's a whiny ass pussy. His live journal, which he doesn't think anyone knows about is full of whiny goth poetry. His current mood is always """"apathetic"""" and his music is always some obscure punk band that no one has ever heard of. Some people who pretended to be his friend so they could get access to his """"friends only"""" posts grabbed some of his poetry and made a book from them, and called it """"ode to faggotry"""" when they found out other goth kids would actually read it, they changed the name to """"Leaves of Grass"""" and it sold like goth cakes. Walt Whitman to this day doesn't know they're selling his poems and making a fortune off him. They still don't invite him to any parties though, because no one likes him. 

 Walt Whitman died a lonely man in Walt Disney Land. He was on the gondola ride, and he fell out because he wasn't fastened properly to the restraint. Thanks to his dumb ass, now none of us can ride it anymore. Thanks a lot Walt Whitman.""",0

 :::Rosa, I think this might help.  In mathematics, if you can define a set of rules, that's consistent with itself, then you can work with those rules.  According to the definition of """"sum"""" and """"equals"""" that most of us are used to, it makes no sense to say that 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 . . .  equals anything. 
 :::However, there are other, somewhat more generous, ways of defining """"sum"""" and """"equals"""", that don't contradict our ordinary, finite, arithmetic, but which produce some additional surprising results with infinite sums.  There are definitions and sets of rules under which experssions like the one in this article can make sense, and add up to a particular number.  Within those rulesets, the sum is, oddly enough, 1/4. 
 :::I think one good way to see how that could possibly work is to consider this: if you take the series (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 . . .), and write it down 4 times in just the right way, you can see how all the positive terms and all the negative terms cancel out, except for one of the initial 1's.  Thus, four copies of the series add up to 1, so each one must equal 1/4. - 01:30, 19""",0

 == Reply to Tomananda == 

 Friend, 

 Fa- rectification is not a """"practice""""... it is part of cultivation...The closest phrase I can find to it is the Hindu concept of  """"Dharma Punastaapana""""... The dharma/teachings (Fa) rectifies the practitioners own heart... eliminating all evil within and the evil within the cosmic space encompassed by his bodies( not the physical body).... evil doesnot mean """"evil people"""" ... there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH CONCEPT... EVIL refers to aggregates removed from the nature of the cosmos(zen shan ren) that control human thinking .... for instace ancient hindustani scriptures say... """"you may hate sin... but never hate the sinner""""... 

 See what Li Hongzhi says about homosexuality: 
 """"You are wantonly indulging your thoughts. Your thoughts, like the ones I just mentioned, are not actually you. The mentality that makes you homosexual was driven by postnatally-formed bad things. But you yourself were numbed by them and went along with them and wallowed in the mud. You need to find yourself again and stop doing those filthy things. Gods view them as filthy."""" 

 ...we see that homosexuality is strongly opposed in all traditions including gnosticism( see quote above from pistis sophia) and Buddist scriptures.. homosexuality is bad... doesnt mean homosexuals are!!!!!! ... hatred is bad.. doesnt mean who ever has felt hatred is!!! 

 ... all cultivation ways clearly distinguish between aggregates that manipualte human thoughts to make them accumulate karma and the person himself.... They also point out that some of the greatst cultivators have arisen from the sinnrs of the past... 

 .. we see that in the teachings, cultivators are asked.. never to harbour even the slightest trace of hatred against the police men who torture them in prison... not to see it with human thoughts... to see that they themselves are being manipulated by the """"evil""""...  

 ... The content you are trying to add is terribly inaccurate....

 :""""On December 1821, a national assembly with 67 deputies was gathered in Argos, which transferred itself soon after to Epidaurus. It was proclaimed, solemnly, the independence and a provisory Constitution was elaborated (1 January 1822), which was called Organic Law of Epidaurus. The Phanariot Prince Alexander Mavrocordato was elected president, or proedro, aided by a secretaty of state, Theodorus Negris. Greece was constituted as an independent federal state, after that was decreted the blockade of the cities still under the rule of the Ottomans. In the West, despite the warm popular manifestations, in favor of the Greeks, the governments kept themselves noncommitted, even hostile to the movement. Metternich, leading the European politics, saw, more than anything else, the Greek independence as a rebellion against the legitimate authority of the Sultan. Due to that, he ordered that the Greek envoys in Laybach not be welcomed ... On April 1822, the great punitive expedition sent by the Sultan disembarked in Chios and laid waste to the island with an astonishing ferocity. of the 90,000 inhabitants, 23,000 were massacred and almost 50,000 women and children were sold as slaves. Andre Miaulis, however, reorganized the Greek navy, and with great audacity, managed to defeat the Turkish fleet, killing its chied and more than 3,000 men of its crew. (p.168)""""

The expedition to Brazil would be sent without delay and the desired recolonizaton would begin with all probabilities of acchieving easy success. Thus, two letters from the Greek emmissary were immediately sent to D. Pedro and an extensive list with the names of the most noteworthy people in General Senata of Megara and in service of the Greek navy. The prince-regent, however, did not betray the confidence the Brazilian nation had on him, which had acclaimed him its Perpetual Defender ... And, this, the Prince D.

 At the very least, please acknowledge that these are not definitions of class IIB. These are """"suggested phrases for writing a recommendation"""".

 Like I said elsewhere you have an amazing ability to see bad faith conspiracies, and a strange way to spin each of these differences in a quite misleading way. Here is my account of your differences: 
 * You seemed to be harassing this editor by edit warring on his own talk page. I was standing up for the guy and telling you to leave him alone. His talk page is his own. If he reverted your warning then we can assume that he read it. Restoring is just harassment in my book. Also, I was not following you but  watching that editor since he was making good contributions on the article, and agreeing with me. Naturally I am interested in following his other edits. 
 * Not mistaking you for someone else. You were blocked for making more than one revert and are on some kind of 1 revert parole. I just did not know it was only for some subjects in particular. Instead of explaining this to me, you simply reverted my message to you under the very uncivil edit summary """"removing trolling.' I'm no troll. 
 * Since you didn't have the civility or courtesy to explain anything to me, I logically asked someone else about your restriction because if you are violating it, stopping you would be good for the article since your very disruptive there in my view. Unfortunately your 1 revert parole was not for all articles.  
 * Why should I leave another message on your talk page to apologize to you after you called me a troll and reverted my message? That is very funny. If you acted like a decent fellow then I would assume you would be open to more messages from me. Why would I give you another reason to call me a troll again? 
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DHeyward&diff;=prev&oldid;=204600038 Nothing mysterious here, and nothing to do with me. You were reverting this editors talk page, after he has reverted. I guess you taught him that bad lesson since he did the exact same thing you did to him.  Again, nothing to do with me. 
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_the_United_States&diff;=next&oldid;=204402646 This is a simple content dispute on an article I’m much more active on than you are. Calling this harassing or stalking is absurdly ridiculous.]  
 *  No defamation at all. These are facts and I saw nothing wrong here. No, I never claim last week that he knew nothing about this. I‘ve always said I did know, but I never know anything about privacy issues. You stated that you changed your user name to your real name.

 ==Kenny's Death== 
 So...you have to look up the individual episode to find his death? WTF happened to the table? Also should we add an 'Episodes Where Kenny is Prominent' - I mean, he's in almost every non-Season 6 episode, but he's not so important to most of them and usually has under 10 lines.    

 == OR and Cruft. == 

 I have added tags on original research and fancruft because of such things as his talents section and his friends section. Some bits of these sections should be mentioned briefly in his bio, but Wikipedia is not a documentary of all character aspects, and should not go into full detail on whether or not Kyle and Stan are close to the core with Kenny or not. One or two sentences would do just fine. 

 Sirening for original research is due to the bit about the curtains and his parka. I agree, it is heavily likely, but much as we all might agree that's where it's made from, due to wikipedia's policy against unverifiable claims, it cannot be included here.    

 I added the 'Talents' and 'Friends and Family' section because most of the other characters have it. I'll remove parts of them.    

 C'mon here, I've removed most of the 'Fancruft' and now it's down to his best friend and family - it NEEDS to be there. The other main boys have it and they don't get the stupid tag, so can it be removed now?    
 :Do you know how to remove a tag? If so, you can take the fansite tag off.    

 I thought normal users couldn't remove tags.    
 :Oh, but they can. I put tags up and down on lots of articles, for lots of reasons. I'll take it down if you'd rather, though.    

 I removed """"Fancruft"""" - I removed most, if not all, Fancraft pointed out above, and kept enough that it should not be removed unless it's also removed from the other articles, as well as """"Length"""" because I'd say it's about as long as the other boys' articles now.    

 ==Character Biography== 
 Perhaps we should add a sort of 'Biography' of him in the aritcle - it might fall under 'Chateracterization' - I more so mean a history of him from the earlies to later episodes in order and etc. Is it a good idea? Would the article be too long then?    

 == Contradictory == 

 Aren't these statements contradicting one another? 

 Kenny is famous for dying in almost every single South Park episode, although in reality, he has only died 79 times in 174 episodes. Kenny has only died five times since he returned in Red Sleigh Down. 

 Kenny has only survived four episodes he was present in before Kenny Dies: Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo, Fat Camp, and Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow. He died in Rainforest Schmainforest, but was revived and lived to the end of the episode''. Umm...  Greenday21 

 == Possibly incorrect == 

 The article currently says, """"The only time Kenny did not die and the famous saying was uttered was on Make Love not Warcraft, when his Warcraft game avitar died."""" Is this correct? What about the Fat Camp episode where Kenny is arrested for prostitution and Eric Cartman's impostor takes Kenny's place and dies. I believe Stan and Kyle say, """"Oh my god, they killed Kenny... sort of,"""" """"You bastards... I guess."""" I am not sure, though.

 Although the Hemobag is a commercial product, it is legitimately one of about 3 ways to process and transfuse a patient's own autologous blood during surgery.

 You reversed my correction related to ORTHONORMAL matrices. 

 I think you should do some research or consult true mathematicians.  In physics as in econometrics, it is a habit to call orthogonal matrices which are really orthonormal.  This is because they usually work with normalized vectors or automatically normalize vectors and matrices.  But the true mathematical definitions differ as a perfectly orthogonal matrix, which is not normalized is NOT its transpose-inverse. 

 Simple example: 

 A = [1,2 / -2,1], is ORTHOGONAL and its transpose is At = [1,-2 /2,1]  
 BUT:   A.At = [5,0 / 0,5] is obviously not the identity matrix.   

 There atre two different names because there are two different objects. 

 Physicists and economists may call it what they want, but in mathemetics, orthogonal does not mean orthonormal.

One of those other languages happens to be German.

Your apparant hatred and disrespect for the German language is disgusting. You should hate English more, since it is the language that reshoim like Eric Yoffe speak; you should hate Russian, for it was the language that Stalin spoke; you should hate Yiddish, since Herzl spoke it; you should hate Modern Hebrew, since the tzionim speak it; you should hate .... well, any language on the world. It just happens to be that German is no more than a language, and a language frequently used by Jews at that. Yiddish (which I assume you don't speak) is 98% German, and many eltere yidden in Yerushalaim, especially the ones from Austria and also Yerushalmim like the Prushim and many other people in Austrian/Hungarian groups, speak fluent German also.

 == Economizer's new edits == 

 quoting yoru new section “This contrasts with the subjective theory of value as an explanation for differing prices of goods, which says that value is determined by a good's ability to satisfy a want and its scarcity.” Ricardo himself discusses this verry topic (scarcity and desire in shaping exchange-value) in the his “Principles”. So again you're erecting a strawman artilce so that you can contrast it with your original research (which is only original in that it plagarizes Ricardo and then uses him as the strawman against which your article is contrasted).   
 :I noted that Ricardo found exceptions to his labor theory of value. But, he did not abandon it in favor of the subjective theory. The labor theory clearly cannot explain exchange value, the adherents to the labor theory tried for a long time. By the way, now you're getting nasty again, by claiming I'm plagiarizing Ricardo.   

 :: We're not talking about exceptions to his labor theory of value. We're talking about his theory of exchange-value where he always sees exchange-value influenced by value along with scarcity and desire for a commodity. He doesn't use the term LTV nor does he use the term subjectivist, because those terms are contemporary terms. But the contrast you make is completely contrived. You provide no supporting evidence from Ricardo that supports anything you say about his theory of exchange-value. BTW, are you saying that for the subjectivist theory, production conditions do not effect exchange-value. Because then I could see the contrast. But you should probably just contrast it with contemporary neoclassical economic theory that more people are familiar with, because neoclassical theory (like Ricardo) holds that both production conditions and scracity effect exchange-value. And you've gotten nasty by claiming an article that carfeully cites sources is original research while working on an article that cites no sources whatsoever (the subjectivist theory of value)   

 :::Saying that I think you're engaging in """"original research"""" is not accusing you of doing anything malicious or dishonest. It just means that I think you're drawing your own conclusions from things instead of referencing sources that draw those conclusions. I could be right or I could be wrong. Your statements may be referenceble or they may not be. If they're not referenceable than they shouldn't be here. I don't doubt that you're doing your honest best to try to interpret correctly. Don't accuse me of """"plagiarizing."""" Plagiarizing means taking someone's words and claiming them as my own. If you think the subjective theory of value article is original research, then by all means put some tags up so we can verify things. This is how Wikipedia articles are improved. Please work with the process. Above all, don't think that the article will ever be stable even if a consensus is reached, because new people are always coming in and a new consensus has to be reached. If you worked on the ariticle before and got it the way you wanted it, great. But everything in this article will be erased and redone in another way over and over and over. It's very sysiphian. I look it more as a learning experience than anything else. If all my work is destroyed in time, and it will just as yours will, I really don't care.   

 :::: It's not my work per se that I'm trying to proect. I understand how wikipedia works. However, this article and many artciles related to this are subject to very hoaky edits like the ones you've been trying to make. People want the LTV to be a certain strawman theory so that they can knowck it down. They  have countless obsscure authors no one haw ever heard of to cite. Or they cite reputable suthors but construe them in ways that are entirely unsupportable (your quotation of the very first heading in Ricardo's ‘Principles’ comes to mind). Besides that heading, there's very little in the chapter that supports the ridiculous strawman position you accuse Ricardo of. The whole thing degrades the Wiki experience (for editors/contributors and readers alike). So I don't care much that my work is sacred or that my prose should not be touched. But this is an article I care to see held to decent academic standards. Whereas many people (who think the LTV is anacrhonistic) want to the article to serve some auxillary purpose. 

 :::: So I welcome honest contributions from those who've read primary and secondary sources on the LTV. And I welcome contributions to the criticism section from those critical of the theory (those I'm less familiar with). But I don't support the view that the critics should be the one defining the theory to make their jobb of criticism easi",0

So when I come to speak of the future I shall consider what chance there can be for a reversal of the present Israeli policy of expansion and domination. I believe that there are encouraging signs of a change in Israeli opinion. 

 But first I wish to go back to Resolution 242 to review those criticisms which have been made, and to suggest additions of major importance. I look forward to a day when we shall have two Resolutions-Resolution 242 setting out the agreed principles and the second complementary Resolution, also unanimous I trust, setting out the means and methods of putting the accepted principles into practical effect. Now what we need is not a retraction of the principles unanimously agreed thirteen years ago but a clear lead to end the drift and show the way to a secure peace.

The Old Rugged Cross was sung very frequently in the churches my parents took me to.

  The emblem of suffering and shame; 
  And I love that old cross where the dearest and best 
  For a world of lost sinners was slain. 
  Refrain is:  
  So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
  Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
  I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
  And exchange it some day for a crown. 
  O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, 
  Has a wondrous attraction for me; 
  For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above 
  To bear it to dark Calvary.

  In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, 
  A wondrous beauty I see, 
  For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, 
  To pardon and sanctify me.

  Its shame and reproach gladly bear; 
  Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away, 
  Where His glory forever I’ll share.

 OneGuy has unilaterally deleted the link to onesuck as """"spam"""".  I have reverted it pending the result of these numerous votes.

 ::Um, aren't we discussing it on the Talk page?  And isn't there a vote going on right now as to what to do with the link?    

 ::: We are discussing it, yes, but I haven't seen you discuss it. When you revert to the previous version at least post some justification as to why you think that version is better. This poll was setup just few minutes before you reverted the page. Tony Sidaway and SPU (basically two people) want to insert a link to this site porn site: solosuck.com. If you go to the site, it's basically a site setup to sell video tapes for 50 dollars. Like all other porn sites, it has some sample pictures and video clips, but basically the site is a commercial porn site selling video tapes. Search the web and you will find thousands of other porn sites on this topic selling something.  Why should we randomly choose one commercial porn site and give them free advertisement on Wikipedia? Since you reverted the page to the version with spam link, I would like to see your justification   

 :: If you find one with better stills and video clips, or better yet, one with stills and video clips and other useful content, we can discuss whether to list than one.  Meanwhile I think solosuck is very good. |

 3) removed  Items included with the boxed game are not the only items available for use in the game; Auran offers a download station (or DLS) which hosts over 10000 custom built objects, including decor elements as well as drivable trains. as advertising.  Mention of third party content is added below. 

 4) general grammar and tidy up. 

 ===Driver section=== 
 1) added a reference to explain the link between Surveyor and Driver (bearing in mind that this is descriptive of all versions of Trainz). 

 2) general grammar and tidy up. 

 ===Scenarios section=== 
 1) removed Scenarii are beeing replaced by the more popular session concept which requires less scripting and can be created in 'Surveyor' rather than having to be fully scripted from a third party application. because 

 a) it's disputable.  Scenarios still exist in the game (as a discrete module, and it is the module which is being described here). 

 b) it's confusing, and I don't imagine it conveys much meaning to anyone not already familiar with TRS. 

 And a note on the whole """"scenarii"""" thing - whatever you personally think is the plural of scenario, the game module is called 'scenarios'''.  So it makes sense to refer to it as such in this article, no? 

 ===Additional features section=== 

 1)removed the header, as most of that described were not 'Additional features' of the game. 

 2)removed the paintshed section - with hindsight, I guess a description of paintshed should be readded, and I will do so. added a new para on Paintshed. 

 3)removed Trainz Discussion Forum, as pretty much all games have a discussion forum and it's not a notable feature.  A link to the forums is at the bottom of the article. 

 4)removed Language Beta Translation Group - there were translations which were created, but subsequently not used?  What relevence has that to anything?  If anything, it sounds like a subtle POV - a complaint from a member of the LBTG that their work was not used, perhaps? 

 5)removed Content Creation Group, for similar reasons as the LBTG.  It's confusing to someone who doesn't already know what it is, for one thing.  also, an additional reference to third party content has been added, see below. 

 6) removed Trainz on the Road - certainly an interesting phenomenon but it doesn't really say much about Trainz itself.  Auran rewarded demonstrators with premium access to its DLS facilities. sounds a bit funny.  Advertising? 

 ===History section=== 

 Generally tidied up and made more readable. 

 ===Other changes=== 

 removed the little box graphics - they don't mean anything to anyone who doesn't know what they already are, they don't add anything to the article, they look untidy and they are inconsistent (there is no icon for scenarios'', for example). 

 added Trainz also has a large content creation community, who use modelling software such as Gmax to create additional scenery and rolling stock models for use in the game.  The more recent versions of Trainz include a lot of third-party content, and registered owners of the game can download (and upload) third party content via the Trainz website. as a NPOV description of the third party community. Captain scarlet has incorporated this para into his latest edits so I guess it's acceptable.""",0

 :::The root of the conflict between the Christian Abyssinians and the Muslim peoples of Adal actually dates much earlier to the 9th or 10th centuries, when Zeila was still Adal's headquarters

The kingdom of Zeila, centre of the Adal Sultanate, is mentioned under this name first by Al-Yaqubi, then in the second half of the 10th century references occur in al-Istakhri, Ibn Hawqal, and al-Muqaddasi. Later descriptions come from Ibn Said, Maqrizi, and Abu'l-Fida.

 == Is the """"Kifu"""" recording system used to record Shogi games? == 

 Kifu is the system for recording games of Go.  Since pieces never move in Go once placed on the board, Kifu records a game by drawing a diagram of the board in the end position and numbering each piece to show on which move it was placed.  The Kifu topic page was included in category Shogi, and said that it was also used for Shogi, but I see nothing on this page about it and I don't see how it would be applicable to a game where the pieces move about. 

 I've removed all references to Shogi on the Kifu page, but on the off-chance that it is in some way connected I'm leaving this request for more info here.  Maybe Kifu is Japanese for """"game record"""" or something and is a general term used by Shogi players?

Iravan of the Sanskrit heritage, Aravan of the Tamil and Irawan of Java are discussed in same article, even though their names are different and their legends differ.

You keep returning to the CIA as """"reliable"""", but any 'factbook' that lists the United States as an older country than Great Britain does not inspire confidence.

Just because someone in the USA is Chicano doesn't mean they support Spanish bilingual education, for example. And often the strongest resistance to restoring Native American languages often comes from Native Americans who are monolingual in English.

56fcdbd1286afcec,"""Yes. Even Encyclopedia Britanicca defines Charavaka as an Indian Philosophy and not as an Hindu sect. [Charvaka]. All the scholars of Hinduism claim that those Indian traditions are Hindus. They want to absorb all the Indian tradition and call them under the term """"Hindu"""". Now the sources which are being presented on Charvaka and Ajivika page to claim that they were Hindus are from mostly Hindu Scholars. Even Jains and Buddhists are not considered as a separate religion but thought of as an Hindu identity. In the Samaññaphala Sutta the philosophies existed at the time of Buddha are explained such as of the Ajivika Makkhali Gosala. Nigatha Nataputa (Mahavira) is also one of them. They disagreed with Buddha's dhamma so should we call them them Buddhists? But all the Hindu Scholars feel proud who even reject their scriptures(Vedas) to call them Hindus. Best regards.

b104c63f31805810,"*I think the current guideline on cite templates (neither encourage nor discourage) is sound. The problem is that many editors are not aware that this is the case, and we need to aggressively discourage the idea that citation templates are required or better than hand-written ones. On the other hand, I think citation templates have a few benefits, and we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater here; moreover, I seriously doubt that editors would unconditionally agree to even discourage citation templates, let alone ban them. This issue is more important and far-reaching than date autoformatting, and we all know how much time it took to change the status quo on that issue.Personally, I don't mind citation templates, and use them often, but would not be bothered if I couldn't use them. I think the more successful path is to strongly encourage moderation: don't provide more information than necessary, and prefer citations at the end of paragraphs rather than after ever sentence. List-defined referencing sounds and looks like a good idea, but we shouldn't try to push it as a Wikipedia-wide standard.",0

It sounds like Ealdgyth and Montanabw are trying to write Frequently asked questions about horses, except that article does not belong in an encyclopedia, does it?    

 :::::: You know what? This article is the first place a lot of folks WILL end up with questions about horses, since it's going to show up high in Google searches.

 ::::::As I've said during the present GA review, I'd like to see a few changes to the structure, but so far as the charge of cruft is concerned I think the article has it just about right. There's a fine line, particularly with domesticated animals it seems, between providing relevant and interesting information and writing a how-to manual.

 == Characteristics statement is incorrect. == 

 The statement that the purplish color of xenon in a neon-light being caused by high amounts of blue, I believe, is false. According to these references, https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/5654/1/V71N06_343.pdf , and A Comparison of Rare-Gas Flashlamps – J. R. Oliver and F. S. Barnes I.E.E.E. Journal of Quantum Electronics, at very low current densities, like those in a neon light, most of xenon's energy is focused in the near infrared, withthe strongest peaks being from 800 to 1000 nanometers, against a background of rather evenly distributed continuum radiation, (white light), that gets fainter as it approaches the blue. The purplish color is caused by the eye's ability, (albeit, just barely), to image the very heavy near-IR output between 750 and 800nm. As quoted from the Oliver/Barnes study: """"light from a xenon lamp has an irregular 
 but continuous spectrum. [] The spectral distribution 
 curves of xenon-lamp radiation at lower current densities usually show a 
 considerable amount of energy in the near-infrared region. An increase in the current density may favor the visible and the ultraviolet 
 regions at the expense of the near-infrared radiation."""" So higher current densities, like those found in flashlamps and arc lamps, produce greybody radiation that is centered in the green, (producing white light), and even higher densities produce blackbody radiation that is centered in the blue. As current densities increase, xenon's spectrum will settle on that of a blackbody radiator with a color temperature of 9800 degrees kelvin, (sort of sky-blue), as referenced in this source: http://optoelectronics.perkinelmer.com/content/RelatedLinks/CAT_flash.pdf .

 First off, I'm sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. The block in question was slated to expire in about two or three hours from the time of this reply, but I've lifted it in any case  if nothing else, the symbology of doing so is important. 

 If it's any consolation, I was not """"drunk with power,"""" but was struggling to deal with a very persistent and abusive user who was stalking valuable editors and vandalizing a wide number of articles (more than could be practically protected from editing, another available tool). I've been a user at Wikipedia for some time, and an administrator for several months, but this is the first time I've dealt with these particular issues on such a scale or intensity. Seemingly credible death and rape threats were being issued not only against a particular user, but also against their family members. The only apparently viable options were for the victim user to stop editing Wikipedia, or for a strong action to deter the troll from further abuse. 

 Before you ask, I did check, and Sympatico is not apparently known for their responsiveness to abuse reports. Very few ISPs are; that's unfortunate for situations such as this, because it might be the best way to actually deal with these sorts of problems. 

 In any case, I tried a brief rangeblock, at first. The block was set only to block anonymous users, and included simple instructions to register an account an evade the block. When that didn't work, I opted to try a longer one, three days, which is what you ran into. 

 It's difficult to know ahead of time how much collateral damage such a block will cause. I truly do hate to think that even one person will have to suffer for the unfortunate actions of one abusive user, and in this case the damage was more than I was willing to tolerate. I've lifted the block, and will strive to avoid such actions in the future. 

 Unlike the apparently faceless admins at many sites, I've found that most enwiki admins are responsive to queries and really do care what their """"customers"""" think. In my case, I'm only human; I have troubles, I get busy or overwhelmed. I do the best I can, but it is inevitable that any person will make mistakes. Chalk it down as a lesson learned. 

 The block should be removed at this time; if you have any problems editing, feel free to contact me or the unblock-en-l mailing list (you'll see instructions for doing so in the event you're blocked).

 == Should eyewitnesses' accounts of what happened during that time be included ? == 

 There are some good personal commentaries found in the internet by people who witnessed how the event unfold.  

 Granted these personal comments can be biased towards the eyewitness point of view, however there are some facts that can be verified, or corrected when more eyewitness come forward to contribute to this wiki. For instance, 

 """"The riots first broke out in the Kampong Bahru/Raja Laut/Chow Kit area..when the Malay mobs armed with parangs came out of Kampong Bahru and started attacking Chinese and Indian passers-by, burning cars and torching Chinese shophouses in the Raja Laut/Chow Kit areas...Chinese gangsters came out to defend the Chinese and Indians and fought with the Malays with sharpened lead pipes...then the Malay regiment came out and started shooting the Chinese with their guns...a lot of people died in the Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman area near the Odeon Cinema. 

 The casualties brought to the KLGH in stages showed that in the first stage, most of the casualties were Chinese suffering from parang wounds..this showed that that the Malays had attacked first and the Chinese were caught by surprise...The 2nd stage casualties were almost equal between Chinese and Malays with parang wounds (Chinese) and wounds inflicted by sharpened pipes (Malays). In the 3rd stage, all the casualties were Chinese many dying from gunshot wounds showed reflected the shooting spree of the Malay regiment....Many of the victims were Chinese and Indians shot by Malay soldiers for """"breaking the curfew""""..what actually happened was that when their houses were burnt by the malay rioters, these non-Malays had to run out and were shot by the soldiers for """"breaking the curfew""""...I remember hearing over Radio Malaysia during the height of the riots that """"curfew breakers would be shot..."""" 

 The mass graves of Chinese at Sungei Buloh and other places with some of the bodies tarred to prevent racial identification was true as described by other bloggers above""""

 ==Trooping the Colour pic == 
 Dear WilD and  - I have received an extraordinary message on my talk page from one  copy my response below:  (I'll still come to both of you for help when needed - mercifully not too often!  -)   ) 

 Dear Jeff G., I refer to your message on my Talk page.  First let me apologise for not """"updating"""" the administrator page.  I had left requests in three areas for the picture when needing it for the article.  I didn't realise that it was necessary to do that, and have been preoccupied with exams to take and the illness/decease of a relative recently.  So I've not been a regular contributor to Wikipedia over the last months.   

 Notwithstanding the above, I am at a loss as to why you would have requested deletion of the image uploaded by a friendly user, namely, , which had already gone into the Trooping the Colour article in response to my call.  It sounds, from the first line of your message  (""""Because none of you saw fit....""""), as if this was a punitive measure.  I had not realised that Wikipedia worked in this way.    

 Does now mean that when that image is deleted, it will disappear from the article?  I would hope not.  I have put hours into finding it.  I am sure, also, that  will have gone to some trouble in downloading it at my request and wonder why you would have nullified his work by deleting it.  

 I have checked the article and it seems to be OK, but perhaps you could kindly leave a message on my Talk page to reassure me on this point. 

 Many thanks.

 :""""Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly.""""  

 :""""Lo! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar (men) from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell,""""  

 :""""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.""""

 :""""And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old. Allah (Himself) fighteth against them. How perverse are they!""""   

 :""""And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers!""""   

 :""""He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may be averse."""" 

 :""""On the Day when (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief ? Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved.""""  

 :""""Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.""""   

 :""""And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do.""""

 ہادی برحقؐ کی رحلت کے بعد مولا علی ؑ نے چھ ما ہ تک خلیفہ اول سے بیعت نہ کی۔ اِس دوران مسئلہ فدک بھی پیش آیا جس میں حضرت عائشہؓ نے سیدہ فاطمہؓ اور مولا علی ؑ کا بھی ساتھ نہ دیا اور اپنے والد حضرت ابو بکرؓ کی روایت کردہ حدیث کی تصدیق بھی کی۔مجھے مفتی صاحب کی اس بات سے قطعی طور پر اختلاف ہے کہ خلیفہ اول کے دور حکومت میں مولا علیؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کے لئے کھڑیاں اس لئے جمع کی گئیں تھیں کیونکہ گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی جمع ہوگئے تھے۔ 

 سبحان اللہ مفتی صاحب ایک طرف آپ فرما رہے ہیں کہ حضرت عائشہ کے گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ بھی بلا اذن داخل نہیں ہو سکتے تھے دوسری طرف آپ مولا علی ؑ کے گھر میں منافقین جمع ہونے کی خبر دے ر ہے ہیں۔ آپ کا یہ بیان کیا متضاد نہیں؟ کیا مولا کا گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ نہیں تھا؟ اپنی اس غلط بیانی پر ذرا خودی غور فرمائیے۔ نیز جن کو آپ مولا علی کے گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی کہہ رہے ہیں ان میں چند صحابہ کرام مثلاً حضرت عباسؓ بن عبد المطلب، حضرت زبیرؓ ،حضرت طلحہٰ، حضرت مقدارؓ ، حضرت سعد بن ابی وقاص اور خود مولا علیؑ بھی شامل تھے۔ نیز سیدہ فاطمۃ الزھرہؓ و حضرت حسنین ؑ بھی گھر میں موجود تھے ۔ لہٰذہ کیا مولا ؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے والے ارباب اختیا ر حضور اکرمؐ کی وصیت بھی بھول چکے تھے جس میں صحابہ کرام ؓ کو تلقین کی گئی تھی کہ میرے شہزادوں کا احترام ، محبت اور تعظیم کرنا۔ 

 ان سب واقعات کے وقوع پذیر ہونے کے باوجود یہ سوال اٹھتا ہے کہ کیا مولا علیؑ اتنے بے بس اور لاچار تھے کہ لوگ ان کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کا پروگرام بنا رہے ہوں اور مولا ؑ خاموش ہیں؟ جواب میں عرض ہے کہ مولاؑ نہ تو خوفزدہ اور نہ ہی لاچار تھے۔ بھلا یہ کیسے ممکن ہے کہ جنگ اخزاب اور جنگ خیبر کا فاتح ایسے موقع پر خوفزدہ ہو۔ اصل بات مولا ؑ کی دور اندیش اور حضور اکرم ؐ کی آخری لمحات میں مولا ؑ کی گود میں وصیت تھی ’’علی میرے بعد تجھے مکر و ہات سے پالا پڑے گا تو دل تنگ نہ کرنا اورصبر کرنا‘‘حضورؐ کی یہ وصیت مولا کے لئے پتھر پر لکیر تھی پھر بھلا صبر کا دامن کیسے چھوڑ دیتے! 
 لکھنے والوں نے تو بہت کچھ لکھا ہے بلکہ لکھوایا گیا ہے۔ لیکن مولا ؑ چونکہ علم دھبی جو اللہ تعالیٰ کی طرف سے حضور اکرمؐ کے توسط سے ودیعت ہوا تھا سے بہتر طور پر سمجھ سکتے تھے کہ مناسب کیا ہے اورکیا نا مناسب ہے ۔ یہی وجہ تھی کہ مولا ؑ نے خلیفہ اول سے خلیفہ ثالث تک پورا پورا تعاون کیا۔ 

 اب ہم آتے ہیں اصل سوال کی طرف کہ کیا اُم المومنین حضرت عائشہؓ کا مولا علیؓ کے مقابل خروج حق پر مبنی تھا؟ 
 اس سوال کا جواب بہت تفصیل طلب ہے۔ مختصراً عرض کردوں کہ ماں جی تمام امھات المومنین سے زیادہ علم رکھتی تھیں۔ آپ نے قرآن پاک کی مندرجہ ذیل آیات بھی یقناًپڑھی ہونگی:۔ 
 ۱:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۶)۔ ترجمہ: نبیؐ مومنوں کے ساتھ خود ان کے نفس سے بھی زیادہ تعلق رکھتے ہیں۔ اور آپؐ کی بی بیاں ان کی ما یں ہیں۔ 
 ۲:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۳۱-۳۲)۔ ترجمہ: 	  ۳۱  اے نبی کی بی بیو تم معمولی عورتوں کی طرح نہیں اگر تم تقویٰ اختیار کرو۔ ۳۲: اور تم اپنے گھروں میں قرار سے رہو۔ 
 مذکورہ بالا احکام کی روشنی میں ممکن ہے حضرت عائشہؓ نے صحابہ کو تلقین کی ہو لیکن زیادہ احتمال یہی ہے کہ دیرنہ عدوات جو کہ انسانی فطرت ہے اورمشیروں کے غلط مشوروں سے خروج ہوا۔ ماں جی کو یقین تھا کہ مولا ؑ قاتلانِ عثمان میں شامل نہیں ہیں بلکہ مولا علیؑ نے آخری دم تک ؟؟؟؟ اپنے شہزادوں کے حضرت عثمانؓ کا ساتھ دیا۔ حضرت عائشہؓ ایک عالمہ فا ضلہ ام المومنین تھیں ایک عرصہ حضور اکرمؐ کر قربت میں گزارہ تھا اور اس پر فخر بھی کیا کرتی تھیں۔ 
 آپکے علم میں یہ دو حدیثیں تو ضرور ہونگی جن کا مفہوم یہ ہے:۔ 
 ۱: اے علی میرے بعد تمہارے ساتھ یہ اُمت دعا کرے گی تم میری ملت پر زندہ رہو گے۔ (کنز العمال علی متقی الجز سادس ۱۰۷۲) 
 ۲: 	 اے عائشہؓ میرے بعد تم ایک گروہ کی قیادت کرو گی جو نا حق ہو گا۔ مقام خواب پر تمہاری اونٹنی پر کتے بھونکیں گے۔ 
 ۳: 	 حضرت عمار بن یاسر کو ایک باغی گروہ قتل کرے گا۔ 
 اتنی واضح احادیث ہوتے ہوئے بھی مولا علیؑ کے خلاف خروج چہ معنی دارد۔ پھر مولاؑ بھی وہ جن کی شان شیخ سعدیؒ نے فرمایا۔ 
 بعدازمصطفےٰ در کل عالم 	  نہ بُد فاضل ترو بہتر ز حیدر ؑ 
 بہر حال ماں جی نے خروج جن حالات اورجس وجہ سے کیا ظاہری تو ایک فطری عداوت ہی لگتی ہے۔ ورنہ مائیں تو اولاد کو صُلح و امن کا ہی مشورہ دیتی ہیں البتہ انکے خروج سے نہ صرف جنگ جمل ظہور پذیر ہوئی بلکہ جنگِ صفین، واقعہ حُرہ، سانحہٰ کربلا اور نہ جانے کتنے فتنے برپا ہوئے اور ہوتے رہیں گے۔یقیناً ماں جی کو اس حدیث مبارکہ کا بھی علم ہوگا جس میں حضور اکرمؐ نے فرمایا ’’عنقریب میرے اہل بیت میرے بعد میری اُمت سے قتل و غارت دیکھیں گے اور ہمارے سب سے زیادہ بغض رکھنے والے دشمن بنو اُمیہ، بنو المغیرہ و بنو مخدوم ہونگے (حدیث صحیح بخاری باب الفتن نمبر ۷)۔ ‘‘

 Regardless, the picture of dolphin evolution is perfectly sensible. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that some land-based ancestor of hippos adapted to the sea and developed into the cetaceans. This population eventually diverged over a period of several million years (about 30 My for the branch that covers all river dolphins) into various genera, the four river dolphins amongst them.

9b48efd55d58b6ba,"""::::, thank you for stopping by. Having invited you to mediate, I don't want to be tendentious, but I will attempt a single cycle of checking to make sure you understood my concerns.  The conclusion that """"Only 31% of men prescribed finasteride met the eligiblity criteria for the pivotal trials"""" required two logical steps. 

 :::::1) The authors reviewed the eligibility criteria for the pivotal (pre-approval) clinical trials, and 
 :::::2) They aggregated and interpreted previously unpublished data about men prescribed the drug from the Northwestern University Enterprise Data Warehouse. Specifically, they set criteria for choosing a comparison population (those administered 1.25 mg or less per day) and analyzed the characteristics of this population to determine the frequency of men having conditions that they believed would have excluded them from the aforementioned trials. This gathering and interpreting of unpublished data to my mind represents pretty much the definition of primary research.  

 The latter step involved a number of judgement calls that require review by a secondary source.   
 :::::1) The authors determined """"eligibility"""" by matching the ICD-9 codes of patients from the Northwestern database to relatively vague statements of exclusionary criteria such as """"A history of any illness or condition that might confer additional risk or confound the results"""".  For example, the authors stated that 4.5% of their patients would be ineligible due to obesity, but obesity is not explicitly stated to be an exclusionary criteria for any pre-approval trial.  They presumably decided on their own that obesity """"might confer additional risk"""".    
 :::::2) A secondary source is needed to assess whether the population that these authors analyzed is representative enough to make the study itself significant.  According to Table 2 of the source document, 8.5% of the patients prescribed propecia at Northwestern would have been ineligible for the pivotal trials because they had cancer.  7.1% were ineligible because of substance abuse issues, 27% were ineligible due to heart disease or hypertension, and nearly 17% had """"disorders of the male genital organs"""".  I personally find it it difficult to believe that nearly 10% of those prescribed propecia nationally have cancer.  This seems to me to be primary research in every sense of the word, and in need of a secondary source for interpretation.  

 ::::All these things being said, I invited you to mediate, and will not pursue this issue further should you still disagree with me after reviewing these comments.  ||

a1c87d8055e3d4b5,"""Yes, I was taking a dig at you there.  But in the most mild of ways, and you took the baitas you have previously demonstrated you respond only to what is convenient.  Your use of """"hypocrisy"""" here is motivated by the assumption that users of these pages are preoccupied with them.  There is no more reason to assume that an occasional user has multiple monikers than there is to assume that a frequent user does not have multiple monikers.  But you seem not to get the point about erroneous assumptions.   And, among other things, you clearly don't know the difference between an assertion based on factual information and the deriving of a conclusion.  But let's put that aside and look at your presentation of the birth issue, in a non-birth section: 

 Heaven and earth society, overseas travel 
 A """"Heaven and Earth Society"""" sect known as Tiandihui has been around for a long time.[41] The group has also been referred to as the """"three cooperating organizations"""" as well as the triads.[41] Sun Yat-sen mainly used this group to leverage his overseas travels to gain further financial and resource support for his revolution.[41] 

 According to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States at a time when the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 would have otherwise blocked him.[42] However, on Sun's first attempt to enter the US, he was still arrested.[42] He was later bailed out after 17 days.[42] In March 1904, while residing in Kula, Maui, Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the Territory of Hawaii, stating that """"he was born in the Hawaiian Islands on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870.""""[43][44] He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.[44] Official files of the United States show that Sun had United States nationality, moved to China with his family at age 4, and returned to Hawaii 10 years later.[45] 

 Several things here:  1.  Concerning the expedience interpretation you cite two people:  one is an anthropologist, who wrote a general book about Macao.  He is definitely not a Sun scholar.   The mention of this issue in his book is incidental, but you cite that singular reference three times.  2.  The other person is not a historian.  She was a civil servant in San Francisco for 30 years, and the publication that is cited is ideologically bent toward the KMT, which takes Sun's purity as essential to the sacred postion he holds among the pro-China advocates.  3.  You then draw a conclusion for the reader (based upon original research?) """"He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.""""  In other words, you put this information into a context that you are comfortable with.   

 Let's also look at the history of the wiki-war:  the birth information had been there for a long time, until you changed it.  In other words, you started the war.  Why didn't you start with the talk page, especially since the talk page had already dealt with this issue?  As for how many people endorse your view and how many endorse Taichi's, this page has many followers, but only you, your alter, and the wiki editor who clearly knows nothing about the case got involved.   

 A few more things:  if an editor decides to block anyone, he or she should block all parties to this recent dispute.  Use a single, not a double standard.  Also, check the history of edits and the history of what was said and when it was said, in the talk section, before rendering judgment as to who is the trouble-maker.

 == List of living centenarians == 

 Hello. I started an article list of living centenarians last night and found it being considered for deletion today. Unfortunately my computer skills (compared to advanced editors) are quite low. Therefore I had been expecting for someone else to create this article and requested its creation a few weeks ago. However since none of the editors deemed its existence essential, I decided to start the article myself. 

 As for the importance of this list I can say that it could save a huge amount of time for some researchers. Indeed, several longevity and centenarian fellows I know have emphasized that the best way to detect """"fresh"""" centenarians (notable people who've just turned 100) is visiting Wikipedia's list of centenarians. However, as you might see this article is split in 18 pages which is the core of the problem. Now imagine a researcher clicking on all of those 18 links separately and checking all the centenarians on those lists who've turned 100 in 2010. Obviously, this process is time-consuming. I do believe it would be much more convenient to click on List of living centenarians, sort entries by age and simply observe new entries. That would take a few seconds and make researchers' lives much more easier.  

 In fact, none of the lists concerning centenarians need to be deleted. What has to be done for efficiency is the reorganization of these lists so that an editor doesn't have to write an entry twice. That is, by adding a living person to one of those 18 lists the same entry is automatically added to the list of living centenarians and on the contrary. This is where my low computer skills show up as I have no idea how to do that. I'll be extremely thankful for any support in organizing the list of centenarians as a whole since currently the article is inefficient and very time-consuming for most researchers.""",0

 :::::I still disagree with leaving the sentence as is. I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 == Anarchism and how long could it exist == 

 Well I was thinking about anarchism this day and I've bumped into a problem: 

 1.) Anarchism from a Capitalist State 

 If there's a goodly working Capitalist Democracy, and then through a revolution it turns into Anarchism(wich is the abolishment of every law and governmental oppression) Companies would surely take the power because only they have enough money for weapons. So Anarchism will become """"Capitalism Liber"""" wich isn't really better than the original government, because they could even kill the residents if they want to. 

 2.) Anarchism from a Communist State 

 Yes, I've already philosophised about how anarchism created from a socialist society would work(nearly everything is controlled by state and there's strict authority) then it would turn out like this: New groups would form and there would be a bloody competition for previously state-controlled facilities and they will taxatate the use of them so it's basically the same """"Capitalism Liber"""". 

 3.) So how anarchism could be stable? 

 Well, I think that the strongest bond that could hold the people together in the state of absolute freedom is Religion. Maybe if there would be a religion wich STRICTLY OPPOSES CAPITALISM, and MONEY Anarchism could be maintained by the followers of that religion. And if there would be an ORGANIZED MILITARY just for DEFENCE, than this would hold people together also and defend from invasions, and it won't destroy the ABSOLUTLY FREE STATE OF SOCIETY. 

 What do You think about my opinion? I would gladly go into a philosophical argument.;)

 In the discussion on currentness of research, Lee Gerhard's name came up as one who might be excluded. Kim Peterson linked to a google scholar search that shows recent publications. I've looked a bit closer at these. To sum up: all his journal papers have been in AAPG Journal (American Association of Petroleum Geologists). His geo papers span 1971-82. His recent writings in the same journal have all been on arguing against Kyoto and minimizing GHGs as drivers vs. solar.  

 Here's a link to a search on the AAPG journal site showing his writings: 
 http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/search?field_name=fulltext&field;_value=&andorexacttitle;=and&author1;=gerhard&fmonth;=Mar&fyear;=1921&tmonth;=Mar&tyear;=2007&RESULTFORMAT;=1&hits;=10&sortspec;=relevance&sendit;=Search 
 His geo writings are both long ago and not related to climate (they're about finding oil, as that's the area of science this journal covers.) His recent writings don't appear to be original research on climate so much as commentary. He's definitely a skeptic, but if we were sticking to people who publish on the science of climate, I'd have trouble justifying his inclusion.  

 I read through the powerpoint linked by his entry, and he assembles lots of charts from other people's research with his own read on what they mean. Slide 23 uses a pie chart I recognize from a quite dodgy skeptic site I recently looked into, which had very fishy numbers claiming that two-thirds of the rise in CO2 from 280ppm to today's 380ppm was natural, not anthropogenic. That's just nuts of course, but it underlies the 0.28% anthropogenic share of GHEffect the pie chart claims. (95% water vapour, 4.72% volcanoes, ocean life and animals) 

 Anyway, I feel Gerhard is pretty borderline. He's still publishing, but not from direct research of his own; he's just putting up other people's graphs and discussing how he reads them.",0

 : I don't have time to properly include this in the article, but here are a few answers, from different source as this matter have been heavily discussed by historians: 
 : - Germans overestimated their forces, strategically as they didn't have the means of their ambitious case blue plan and tactically as so far they had rather easily repulsed every soviet offensive   
 : - the German intelligence services failed terribly. They misled the high command in thinking the soviets were strong enough to lauch 2 major offensives (Mars and Saturn) at the same time, hence Russian preparation on the Don river were expected to be done for local attacks and not for a strategical scale offensive. 
 : - the German plan case blue, which led to this overextension of the flancs, was a kind of a gambit  it was supposed to give such a powerfull blow to the Red Army that it wouldn't be able to continue the war, so overextended flancs didn't really matter in front of a dying opponent.  
 : - Operation Uranus was a grand premiere and even the Russian command was unsure of its results until the end (I'd say until the end of operation Wintergewitter in the end of december). 
 : - Russians used military deception (maskirovka) to the fullest, transmitting major orders only verbaly, creating false radio traffic, moving only at night etc... hence the 5th tank army and the Don front were only detected at the very last moment, way to late for the Germans to react. 
 : - 6th army had a chance to escape encirclement by abandoning Stalingrad arround the 21-22 december (before the junction of the soviet armies). Paulus and all his senior officers have issued such a proposal, but this was refused by only 2 key characters  Hitler and von Manstein that was Army Group Don commander and Paulus direct superior.

 ==Taking a crack...== 

 I've attempted a conservative version addressing the concerns expressed by myself and several others above.  I also included additional description of the """"A More Perfect Union"""" speech, which no one seemed in objection to.  I think the poll statistics mentioned by Kossack pretty well wrap up the case for relevancy of the Wright stuff for anyone who remains in doubt.  Although such statistics are not present for the Rezko and Ayers issues, many here, including myself, are of the perception that they are of comparable significance for those Obama is petitioning for votes.  Out of respect for the WP:Weight concerns of Scjessey and others, I cut some details that strike me as not highly relevant in order to make room for those that to me (and others) seem necessary to provide adequate summary.  Forgive me if I screwed up any of the reference tags.  Did my best to keep those straight, but still learning... 

 As far as the recentism concerns go, one point that is made in that essay, which I agree wholeheartedly with, is that, for many reasons, a certain amount of recentism is healthy for Wikipedia.  No one knows what will be viewed as notable and relevant about Barack Obama a hundred or even ten years from now.  Largely, it depends on the outcome in November (or potentially earlier).  For those who think the article should appear exactly as it would a hundred years from now, imagine what would happen to an article this long over someone who once ran for president a hundred years ago.  It would be cut down to a couple of paragraphs at best.  Do you really think that's what should happen to this article?

Also, I thought Michaels was one of the few who used his real stats. Well, not his weight anymore, he definitely lost a lot of weight (it helps w/ his knees and back), but they cant bill him as less, so, aw well.

 I am 5'11"""" and have been face to face with Shawn back in 1998.  He had maybe 1"""" of height on me.  6' is probably an accurate height for him. 

 Shawn Michaels is 6'1 because when he went face to face with RVD and Chris Jericho, he looked taller than them. RVD and Chris Jericho are 6'.

 Langus, Wikipedia policy mandates that articles should be self-contained. If an assertion is used in an article, both the assertion and its use must be justified in that article. The assertion that """"Britain re-established its rule"""" has never been made in scholarly texts and is a WP:FRINGE theory. Jimbo Wales has stated:  

 *If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;  
 *If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;  
 *If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in  
 Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article. 

 We have not been provided with citations to either reference texts or prominent authors supporting the viewpoint that Britain re-established its rule in 1833. Therefore the claim does not belong in Wikipedia. 

 In your discussions with WCM, he just muddled the waters by taking the debate to whether it is true or not that Britain ruled the islands before 1833. We need not delve into that. The only thing that matters here is if the reliable sources available support that view. And the reliable sources, by an OVERWHELMING majority (sorry for the caps, but I NEED to stress that), support the view that the 1833 events were an occupation.""",0

c1cb414aa4f81a8f,"""*****They do include """"candidates that have already won"""" in non-STV systems, however.  This is the """"Wasted vote effect,"""" which is probably worthy of its own article.  Waste is minimized in STV systems, and this particular aspect of waste happens to be reduced to zero.  Also, including wasted and exhausted ballots is done for some elections using computer programs.  See this countback: http://davischoicevoting.org/countback/ackerman/Vacancy%20Round.htm - The 350 ballots that went to elect James Ackerman, along with the 327 exhausted ballots, would have elected replacement Leticia Miller.  Both were from the same party.  Note that the 327 """"exhausted"""" ballots includes the wasted ballots - in this case those listing James and the other winners at the very bottom and those portions that transfered in surplus from them to end up in the exhausted pile after their candidates didn't win.  Note the total votes counted here is 677.61073, although 224.38833 become exhausted again after the initial winners are excluded and candidates start getting defeated since they don't list Leticia or her closest competitor.  Note that some systems don't allow for early exhausted ballots, and exhausted ballots are by necessity wasted. To some degree, there really isn't a meaningful distinction between wasted and exhausted ballots in STV, since STV systems can't waste a ballot by putting more than a quota's worth of votes into a particular candidate - therefore the only wasted votes left are those in the exhaust pile after quotas are filled.  It is interesting that the Australians intentionally don't count the exhausted pile when computing a replacement candidate - this has the effect of ensuring the same votes will remain wasted (and the same people unrepresented), however it also has the effect of making it more certain that the replacement candidate will resemble the original.  Note that the Australian method isn't possible in systems that allow incomplete preference listings if you wish the replacement candidate to represent a full quota - it's virtually guaranteed that at least one of the votes during the countback will exhaust itself before a new candidate is chosen, and if you're only using a quota's worth of votes (those of the original winner), you will by necessity have less than a quota.

That's why I left the information from the New York Times articles that I found. WP:WIAFA requires """"high quality"""" reliable sources.

 ::Sadly, the only sources that are highly reliable are some reviews and interview (if that counts at all). The series just isn't as popular as some others and the author chats are one of the best sources for information for the Warriors articles.

 :::Just as a side comment Derild, if the series were ever made into a movie, there would no end to the pool of reliable sources. Not that I'm trying to discourage you from working towards FA right now. Keep up the good work. I'll try to help out if you need, but I'm quite busy these days.

 - It is a section on criticism, and criticism is rarely """"NEUTRAL"""" (if neutral exists at all - it is at best """"widespread opinion"""") 
 - The criticism mentioned is a not only a very important but also fairly unpopular one because of its direct implications, hence the label """"conspiracy theory"""" that is a very convenient way of ignoring them. 
 - The economists researching this topic are few, and tend to agree (hence, the """"consolidate related criticisms"""". 
 - Don't you think NOT mentioning this sort of criticism is actually more dangerous than letting it be so that people can attempt to refute it? 

 Personally, I came upon this research and it dealt a blow to my views of the banking system, and I haven't found solid refutation so far.

 :Just a comment for the record... A number of pseudoscientists I've heard about have a double standard when it comes to entities such as chakras. For the believers they speak as if these things were already true, real entities, and they even write books or give conferences on their properties and so on, going into great detail; for the non-believers and questioners, they become vague and elusive, they state general non-falsifiable truths, they don't clearly define anything, etc., precisely to avoid scientific (or common sense!) scrutiny. It seems to me that, under the provisions you stated above, science will always be on the losing side.

 I thought that the last version of the """"authorship"""" section prior to removal was clear enough that this was """"nutter-territory stuff"""" that nobody could think Wikipedia was promoting it — and since the subject had been discussed in reliable sources, I thought that a brief mention (and dismissal, by the same reliable sources) was appropriate.  But if an apparent consensus of my fellow editors disagrees, I don't feel strongly enough about the matter to reinstate it. 

 One further point to Kauffner: the reasons you may find Cashill's theory plausible are irrelevant to Wikipedia.  If you want the section reinstated, you need to make the argument in terms of Wikipedia policies such as WP:RS, WP:NPOV and WP:V.  Your goal should not be to convince Wikipedia editors that the theory is correct (it's not, and that's irrelevant); it should be to convince Wikipedia editors that the theory is noteworthy.  See the quotation from Jimbo Wales at WP:WEIGHT: most editors seem to think that this theory is """"held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority"""" and therefore """"does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not."""" If you want this to be included, you need to prove that it's """"held by a significant minority"""" and you need to """"name prominent adherents"""".  Jack Cashill is not sufficiently prominent to meet this standard. —  •  """,0

 1. Do we need to list all of Madonna's awards and chart placements in the intro?  Wouldn't wikilinks to the awards and achievements section (kind of like how it is now, like """"Madonna has received several awards, etc."""") be better for the sake of neutrality and no POV? 

 2. The sales data issue continually goes back and forth.  We get 200, 270, 275, 200 and 75 singles.. Shouldn't we stick to data that has source links (i.e. the WB press release and the Guinness page)?   

 3. Who is deleting the source links from the intro?  I assume it's the same person who keeps inflating the sales numbers.  

 4. I'm not sure madonna ever """"earned the title"""" """"Queen of Pop"""". It's not really a title at all, not at least an official title.  It's just a nickname from the fans and the media. Moreover, is putting that she """"earned"""" it because of her successful albums, controversial image, etc. a bit too POV?  Again, do we even agree it's a """"title"""" she """"earned""""? Isn't it better to say """"she's known for her successful etc."""" and she is """"commonly referred to as Queen of Pop""""? sounds a bit more neutral to me.  

 5. referring to her as singer, actress, pop icon, author, mother, brother, sister, etc.  Would just referring to her as an """"American entertainer be so bad?"""" I'm fine w/ it either way, i'm just curious what other people thing. 

 6.  The idea of the intro, so I thought, was briefly summarizing the article. The way it is now, it says she catapulted to success, she's controversial, etc., won lots of awards, etc., and is currently promoting a new album. Is this a good enough summary? Does it cover all of the basics of madonna?

 Hi Ched - basically if the article is very short, you add a stub template at the bottom of the article (either the plain  or one of the more precise ones - if you simply add , a stub-sorter will change it to a more precise one soon enough, but if you can even make it a slightly more precise one it'll save work later). Usually if it's that short, then it'll be pretty obvious the sort of thing that the article needs.  

 If it's a longer article but still needs work, and you're less sure that it's easy to see what still needs attention, add an expand template at the top instead, and put details on the talk page. The difference between """"short"""" and """"longer"""" is pretty arbitrary and depends a lot on what the subject is (I've got a short essay on that at ), but if it's more than a couple of screens-full of information, it's usually beyond being a stub. Hope you enjoy your time on Wikipedia - keep up the good work ) ... """,0

 ==Article Deletion Discussion== 

 I was looking through the comments on deleting this article, and I saw that come of those who wanted to delete this article made comments such as """"Wikipedia is not a sports almanac"""".  Well, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and according to Dictionary.com, the definition of an encyclopedia is: 

 A book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge...  

 I am somewhat perplexed. If an encyclopedia covers all branches of knowledge, then how is it that any article could be nominated for deletion based on an argument that Wikipedia doesn't cover that subject?  I have had articles deleted based on this argument, and to me it just doesn't hold water, because then the exact same argument could be made for any article.  For example, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a repository for warship information, or Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a musical database, or Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an astrological index.  Using those three arguments, we could eliminate several thousand articles...in fact a similar argument could be used to eliminate nearly any article. Take today's featured article, Stark Raving Dad.  I could argue that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place to put CliffsNotes on Simpsons episodes. How about the article on CliffsNotes?  I could say Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place to put describe corporate product lines. Where does it end? 

 While I concur that blatant advertising, slander, unreferenced work, original research, lewdness, and the like have no place here, deleting an article based on topic opens a huge can of worms. I happens all the time, and it is wrong.

But when one has seen the persistance of a fraction of a quote and the rejection of the fully documented FULL quote which contradicted the malicious editing of the full quote by those using the fraction of a sentence it is clear that there is a substantial flaw in the system by which the Wikipedia is edited.

That is, the Orel counteroffensive, the inability to widen the southern penetration, and the loss up to 11 July did not result in a german decision to give up the offensive (at least in the south). But the effect of the entrance of 5th GTA into the battle on 12 july showed that, contrary to Manstein's assertions, they were not about to break through the last Soviet defenses. On the contrary, this showed that significant Soviet strength remained. Thus the sacrifice of a major part of the 5th GTA may not have been in vain. By the 15th, German units in the south had their warning orders to withdraw.

 ==capitalist destruction wikipedian style== 

 Hey thanks for you insightful comments, you started this article and get much respect from me for all your work on it.  I understand what you're saying about beating them at their own wikipedian game, however I have a real problem with compromise in cases where the other side is vehemently wrong.  The capitalists are (probably unknowingly) deploying a tactic not unlike the tactic in boxing in which one is much weaker than their opponent but tries to get their opponent tired so that they get the upper hand.  I feel this is that path we're going down if we give respect to things that are simply not true at all.  These users have already gone beyond their misunderstanding of anarchism to show truly how ignorant they really are about the subject, actually questioning whether Emma Goldman was for or against capitalism!!  What the fuck?!  At the moment of writing this and in the past I've been trying extremely hard to see how, through the wikipedian perspective, one could justify putting this ideology no bigger than a high school fanclub into a position where it looks like it's a dominant and legitimate ideology (or in this case really the issue is the labeling of it """"anarchist"""").  One must remember that by sheer logic if someone is looking up Anarchism on wikipedia, they most likely want to know more about it or know nothing about it and want to learn what it is.  If someone previously oblivious to Anarchism comes to this article for information and they get the impression that anarchism is not against capitalism, the article's purpose has just ended in self-defeat!  You can only be """"fair to all parties"""" and """"flexible"""" and """"respecting of other's opinions"""" to a point where it makes sense.  To make another stupid example, as I like doing, if someone has the opinion that milk made in the right fashion is not white, should this really be put on the article about Milk, let alone become not only a major part of it but give respect and decree to that belief?  Or, should someone with common sense say """"Are you fucking stupid?!"""" and invalidate their knowledge about milk?  I would certainly choose the latter.  I have to disagree with the assertion that we should not decide this based on sense and on facts.  However, I do agree with you that such arguments will not work for the time being against people who don't care about facts, history, or reality, but only care about what they say to be true, based on ignorance of what they are talking about.  Furthermore strictly on just the subject of being a good wikipedian, it is in Wikipedia's best interest to be factual.  Surely user editability is the biggest thing that sets wikipedia apart from every other encyclopedia, but what I have found and almost everyone I talk to who likes wikipedia, is that on wikipedia you (supposedly should at least) get the truth.  When you look up an article in Britannica, it's written by one person who has a general overview knowledge of what they're talking about, especially in politics, philosophy, and the like, and have errors all over the place, but that's accepted as okay because errors are called """"inevitable.""""  Know why they're inevitable?  Because you have a one man dictatorship defining the definition for EVERYONE to follow!  Wikipedia was created partially on the basis of rejecting that approach to article writing, the goal being to result in fairer more accurate articles.  It is much more important to be accurate than to be """"fair"""" or """"include everybody"""".  Many times, the majority is wrong!  However, in this case the minority is wrong.  This is a true example: out there somewhere on the internet, there is (i'm not kidding) ONE guy that made a shitty little site about combining anarchism and monarchism.  Seriously, I wish I was kidding.  Luckily though, like a lot of stupid people, he's an extreme minority and no one else on Earth besides himself(maybe not even him!) respects such a claim and combination.  SHOULD THE ARTICLE INCLUDE THIS VIEW OR GIVE IT MERIT?  Should it be written that """"some people believe this, some poeple define anarchism as this.."""" in relation to that idea?  Of course not!  It's insane to do so and one doesn't need to get into the factual inaccuracy of something like THAT. )  It truly is the same situtation.  It is a case of a five-year-old jumping up and down saying """"Me too!! Me too!"""" to the anarchist movement and I don't think wikipedia should be an example of catering to those who don't know what they're talking about.  We can't start buckling our knees now and saying """"enough already!  okay okay have it your way.""""  We can't let that happen.   """,0

8332f4d44614c8fa,"Hi Kaldari, 
 I understand. 
 To answer your first question, No. I am not currently being paid to edit any article. 
 I understand the concerns so I'll just go over my contribution history. 
 *Mark Portmann: Created 2 years ago from youthful exuberance. 
 *Babtunde Rotimi: I haven't contacted him, but being a winner of a writing award myself, I was interested in the news article and turned to Wikipedia for information on him. When I found that there was none. I decided to create a page. 
 *EmbroidMe. Paid to create the page which I submitted through the AFC to ensure that it fit Wiki's guidelines. 
 *Gailen David. Like Babtunde, I was interested in the subject because I'd seen a couple of his mock videos. 
 *UassistMe. Contacted by the party that offered me the EmbroidMe project to see if I could help with the page's creation. I submitted it to the AFC, it was turned down, so I politely informed the party that the project was a bust. 
 *Mariana Bierkna. It was listed in Wiki Commons as an article for request that was dated by over a year. Started work on it with help from members of the IRC who sent across PDF files and access to a librarian.  
 *IonRoad: My latest attempt to create a page that was worthy of at least a C class. I chose the subject because it seemed well covered and clearly within the notability requirements of Wikipedia. 

 I did some work for the owner of PhotographyTalk but after I was warned that my efforts amounted to spam, I abandoned the project and was not paid. I believe he hired someone else after that. Before I was hired to work on the UassistMe and EmbroidMe project, I was made to sign an NDA. Considering that this is an open forum, I'm hoping these disclosures will be deleted. 
 I've also been approached at least four times by external parties who wanted to have their articles included in Wikipedia. But after reviewing their companies, I informed them that they did not meet the requirements of Wikipedia.  

 I believe this answers 2 out of Seraphims questions, as to the last 'why have you created so many articles which appear to be promotional and what plans do you have to be remedy it', my only defence is that I did not know that the articles appeared promotional because multiple editors in the IRC channel assured me that they weren't when I requested a review. 
 Regarding my plans of addressing this problem, I believe my proposed probational terms, combined with those suggested by Kaldari and Nick gives me more than enough time to hone my editorial skills.

 The number 30 was used by myself for very good reasons.  You yourself have stated that 29 matrix schemes are still operational - a figure drawn I believe from the matrixwatch.org website.  As my own matrix scheme - www.cyberama.net - is operational but classified as non-operational by matrixwatch.org (why I do not know!), then 30 must be the minimum number of matrix schemes operational currently.  As stated before, this is a conservative number - I personally believe that there are far more but this would be unverifiable without some intense work verifying all known matrix scheme domains.   

 To include the number of matrix sites that have ceased trading would be hard if not impossible - there is no proof that any domains that would be claimed by anyone were ever matrix schemes.  If domains have expired, there is no evidence that either they ever existed or what their content consisted of.  Therefore, I feel it is unverifiable to state any given number of matrix schemes that may have ceased trading.  Stating that many have ceased trading is the best solution, in my opinion.   

 In my mind, the term """"operational"""" regarding a website would mean that it was viewable and that it is possible for it to operate.  Therefore, any matrix scheme that is able to take payment should be regarded as being operational.  www.dictionary.com defines the term as, """"Fit for proper functioning; ready for use"""".  I would have to say that as both Arzel personally and matrixwatch.org have stated that they 'know' 29 matrix schemes are operational, it is silly for them now to backstep and try and say that there is no way to 'know' these sites are operational.   

 Would it be of additional help in the History section to include details on Gotmatrix?  This was also a very well-known matrix scheme that is apparently still operational and trading - and is one of the older websites too.  Greg, the owner, is still answering emails - when he chooses!

 Alexander III of Macedon (356–323 BCE)Alexander was the son of King Philip II of Macedon. The Macedonians claimed descent from the hero Heracles, son of Zeus. They considered themselves Hellenes. 
 Philip, who came to the throne in 360 BCE, did much to promote Macedon’s stature. He patronised the arts, stimulated the economy, and organised an unprecedented strong professional army. In his reign, Macedon became the greatest power in the region. He united the whole of Greece and he placed the previously autonomous Greek city-states under his rule in the Pan-Hellenic League. He married a series of princesses from the defeated territories for political motives, seeking to assure himself of their allegiance. Alexander’s mother, Princess Olympias of Epirus, was the fourth of Philip’s seven wives.

 == Edit Request:Periyar as atheist == 
 First of all, thanks for answering my question. 

 But why should Periyar's views on Islam and Christianity be in Controversies section? On more than one occasion, Periyar has critized organized religions including Islam and Christianity. Is'nt Periyar's statement """" Bane of Tamizhians is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamizhians"""" correct place the """"Religion and Atheism section? 

 Below two statements which are the author's own conclusion portray Periyar as favoring Christianity and Islam. 

 Periyar viewed Christianity similar to the monotheistic faith of Islam. He explained that their faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar. 

 Anita Diehl.(1977) """"Personal View of the author"""" According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and that the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar pointed out that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. 

 Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect 

 Just like Periyar's role as Dharmakartha of Hindu temples and Periyar's not cooking non-vegeteraian food for over a month for accomodating Marimalai Adigalar cannot be construed as his consideration for Hindu religion, the above two statements which are author's self views should removed.""",0

 :I am familiar with the arguments presented in Texas v. White but MRDA """"Well, they would say that wouldn't they?"""". The decision was not decided in a court room it was decided on the battle field. I am not sure if you really believe the POV you are espousing is the truth or if you realise that it is only one interpretation. For example there are two legal arguments that are presented for legal basis or lack of it for the treason trial of Charles I. One is presented by  
 :*The Hon Justice Michael Kirby AC CMG The trial of King Charles I – defining moment for our constitutional liberties, to the Anglo-Australasian Lawyers' association, on 22 January 1999. 
 :The other by 
 :*Geoffrey Robertson (2005). The Tyrannicide Brief: The Man Who Sent Charles I to the Scaffold. Chatto & Windus. pp. 16–17. ISBN 0-7011-7602-4. 
 :Neither man is a negationist, they are both respected Australian barristers, but they have radically different views on the legality of the trial, indeed both men know each other and Robertson was spurred on to write his book in response to Kirby's lecture. Like all good barristers they are experts of presenting a coherent and clear argument to support different interpretations of the same facts in court. The point is that to date you have espoused a point of view, but you have not presented any papers from reliable academic sources that argue that there is any nagationism involved in the different interpretations of state rights etc, or is it that you do you think that the minority views expressed in Texas v. White  are nagationist views if so you have failed to understand the difference between legitimate and illegitimate revisionism. I think a good place to start is for you to present articles that state that the people you think of a negationists are not objective historians.    """,0

 ==Help requested at Criticism of the Seventh-day Adventist Church== 

 The current section titled Cult status at Criticism of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, where the Seventh-day Adventist church is accused of being a cult, is not written in the usual accusation/answer format and displays no rational response to the charge. The statement about """"allegations of Adventist insularism and warnings about mixing with non-Christians and even non-Adventists"""" isn't referenced and the current response, which is also not referenced, that the schools of the cult """"are open to all"""" doesn't refute the charge of being a cult.  

 The current section reads as follows: 

 Disputes have arisen among counter-cult authors over whether Seventh-day Adventism is a cult. 

 In the late 1950s, Walter Martin and Donald Barnhouse classified Adventism as non-cult-like . For Martin, this was a reversal of his earlier 1955 classification of Adventism as a cult. Many evangelicals followed this advice, and continue to do so today, accepting Adventism as an orthodox Christian denomination, even though it holds a few doctrines that are seen as different from mainline Christian churches. This can be viewed as an increasing acceptance of the Adventist church into the Christian fold, since many of these other Christian groups were previously very opposed to Adventist teaching. Although he later reversed this opinion and belief and later expanded his position in his 1960 book-length treatment, The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism. 

 Others class Adventism as an unorthodox Christian denomination, including, for example, John Whitcomb, Jr. Allegations of Adventist insularism and warnings about mixing with non-Christians and even non-Adventists, and the importance placed on Adventist education for children are also major allegations of what is colloquially thought of as cult-like behavior. In their defense, Adventists respond that their educational system is designed to instill character and faith in their children; indeed, Adventist schools are open to all. 

 In describing their opposition to ecumenical changes, some Adventists refer to Ellen White, who wrote that """"Babylon is the church, fallen because of her errors and sins, because of her rejection of the truth sent to her from heaven."""" 

 I propose the following improvement:

 :One of the theories, but hardly a proven fact. Read Idaho Falls for what I think is the definative public account. The operator who pulled the rod out too far, John Byrnes, was recently separated from his wife (crashing at friend's places for the last several nights) and had money problems. Byrnes was mostly at fault in the marital strife: he was a philanderer and drunk. 

 :Richard Legg's wife was a local Mormon girl, several months pregnant, and by all accounts hardly likely to be engaged in any kind of relationship with Byrnes. Most likely, they never met. Both the widows Legg and Byrnes have denied there were any extramarital affairs among them. 

 :The murder suicide rumor had swirled around the industry for years following the accident. It became a semi-official claim when a nuclear safety researcher repeated the rumor in a memo stressing the importance of making reactors operator-proof. Previous reactor safety guidelines always assumed the operators were in their right minds when at work, and instead concentrated on commies with grenade launchers. 

 :The most plausible reasoning I've read was Byrnes resented Legg because Legg was recently given a supervisory role. They had fought some months earlier at a bachelor's party (both men were drunk, and Byrnes had just fucked a whoreLegg probably taunted him about it). Byrnes had a temper, and had been known to throw shit around inside the reactor control room when frustrated. He was recently passed on the same supervisor job. The men were several hours behind in their night's task list. Legg probably said something to chide Byrnes (perhaps officiously restating the rule that the control rod mustn't be raised too far, or telling him to """"excersize it"""" to prevent sticking), and Byrnes just had a """"to hell with this"""" moment and raised the rod too far to piss everybody else off. Kaboom. 

 :There's no evidence anybody, least of all the poorly trained operators, knew that withdrawing the rod too far would lead to an explosion. They knew it could possibly melt down the core, but that wouldn't constitute a murder-suicide.""",0

 * It is an early step to resolve content disputes after talk page discussions have stalled. If it's something we can't help you with, or is too complex to resolve here, our volunteers will point you in the right direction. 

  

 * It is not a place to deal with the behavior of other editors. We deal with disputes about article content, not disputes about user conduct. 
 * It is not a place to discuss disputes that are already under discussion at other dispute resolution forums. 
 * It is not a substitute for the talk pages:  the dispute must have been discussed extensively on a talk page (not just through edit summaries) before resorting to DRN. 
 * It is not a court with judges or arbitrators that issue binding decisions: we focus on resolving disputes through consensus, compromise, and explanation of policy. 

  

 * Discussions should be civil, calm, concise, neutral, and objective.  Comment only about the article's content, not the other editors.   Participants who go off-topic or become uncivil may be asked to leave the discussion. 
 * Let the other editors know about the discussion by posting   on their user talk page.

 Thank you for your contribution to spearfishing.

Citations are for statements that are not common sense and might be controversial.

 I realize that user:Slrubenstein already brought this up at length in the childrearing article, but it's still here. What do you mean here, Cesar? The above sentence gives the impression that anthropologists propose that """"many anthropologists"""" propose cultural relativism as a system of moral values (or lack thereof), while I can assure you that this is not true. I've done some work in the anthropology of human rights - where this issue is fairly important - and there, as elsewhere in sociocultural anthropology, the phrase """"cultural relativism"""" does not mean the same thing as either you or the person you're quoting thinks it does. When anthropologists talk about cultural relativism, they (or we, if you like) are talking about a research methodology, the aim to understand and interpret cultural values from the POV of the culture from which they originate. 

 I'm not trying to just weasel out of this; this is not a moral stance. For example, there are people working in applied anthropology who are studying female genital mutilation from the point of view of the mothers etc who want to have it done to their children: not to write apologias for it, but to understand it so that it can be changed. If you understand the genital mutilation is an important part of initiation rites, you can take steps to try and institute other initiation practices, ones that do not involve genital mutilation. 

 The core tenet of sociocultural anthropology is that to interpret meaning, you have to see it from the inside. Understanding does not imply acceptance.

 Wow, Wilma in the middle of October. This is going to be a bad day for somebody, the question is who? NHC now says that it will scrape the Yucatan Peninsula just short of a major hurricane and head up toward the Mississippi and Alabama coasts. The discussion said that confidence in this prediction is low and the track could shift to the right back towards Florida. All depends on that high over Rita's landfall area. No offense to Florida, but they can take a Category 1 or even a small Category 2 without much heartbreak, Honduras however would be in deep kimshe with even a Category 1. The Yucatan is even tougher that Florida (look how they weathered Emily) so not much worried about them. I'm mostly concerned about our precious gas off that coast. There's not much left to destroy in southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi, however another hurricane hit could make New Orleans uninhabitable for years.

The methodology rests on the relationships between the tracking of information as it moves through states of transmission, storage, and processing; the charting of information security attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability; and judging the information security risks of technology, procedures, and human interventions [Copyright © 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR]",0

 I would have to disagree with the comments above regarding """"scared white-people"""".  For starters, you cannot hide a name like Hussein in the us.  The name itself has a stigma.  It is not meant to """"scare white-people"""", as I am one.  Moreover, it was an internet rumor... similar to the """"send this to 1 million people to raise money for so-&-so to receive a free kidney transplant"""".  There is a lot of garbage on the web, rumors and the like.  I think the point was misinterpretted as trying to """"scare white-people"""" (racist comment if I may), when it was most likely someone saying - """"Do want a 'Hussein' as President?""""  Now I understand that it is not the same family name, rather just a name... but I am willing to bet that was the initial intent.

 == My Defamation on the Diyab Article  == 

 Alright I understand. I wonder, however, if you also screen for the painful bias presented all throughout the Diyab article. This piece makes love to Diyab instead of presenting an objective account of her. It is disgusting particularly because this """"love-making"""" is in flagrant contradiction with the woman's actual merits  which are almost nonexistent. Just recently, she made a complete fool of herself on the BBC one by announcing that all Syrians are better of in their war-torn nation instead of seeking a better chance at life  she also contradicts herself too many times and is a disgrace to all people of the Levant. Of course denying innocent people the support they need does not apply to her because she is educated  unlike the """"barbarians"""" that are going to flood into England. I am not Syrian, nor am in any way affected by the topic she was addressing, but to laud someone like this even on a wiki page is not right.

f76ae0350ebdf55c,"""Miley Ray Stewart is the central character of the Hannah Montana media franchise, portrayed by Miley Cyrus. The character was originated in the currently running Disney Channel series Hannah Montana and also appeared in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Miley is a normal teenage girl who, as her alter ego Hannah Montana, secretly leads a double life as a world famous pop star. 

  

  
 The character was originally named Chloe Stewart but was changed to Miley Stewart.[2] 

 CastingCyrus learned about the casting for a new Disney show at the age of eleven through a Nashville talent agent. She sent in a tape auditioning for the show's best friend role, but received a call asking her to audition for the lead. After she sent in a tape and was flown to Hollywood for further auditions, Cyrus was told that she was too young and too small for the role. However, Cyrus' persistence and ability to sing in addition to act caused the show's producers to invite her back for further auditions. Producers eventually narrowed the large pool of candidates down to three actresses, including Cyrus and Taylor Momsen, and gave the part to Cyrus, then twelve.[3] According to Disney Channel president Gary Marsh, Cyrus was chosen because of her energetic and lively performance and was seen as a person who """"loves every minute of life,""""[4] with the """"everyday relatability of Hilary Duff and the stage presence of Shania Twain.""""[5] 

 Cyrus' casting also led to the casting of her real life father, Billy Ray Cyrus, as the father of her character on the show. Cyrus was initially wary; according to her mother and co-manager, Tish Cyrus, """"Miley's concern at the time was, oh my gosh, people are going to think I only got this part because of my dad.""""[3] However, worried that her family would otherwise have to be separated as they had been when her father first landed the lead in the television series Doc, Cyrus relented and helped audition her father for the part.[3] 

 Character backstoryMiley was born in the fictional town of Crowley Corners in Tennessee on November 23, 1992 (Cyrus's real birth date). Her family consisted of her parents Robby and Susan Stewart and an older brother named Jackson. She also has many relatives in her extended family including her grandmother Ruthie Stewart, Aunt Dolly (played by Dolly Parton), Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl, and a cousin named Luanne. The characterizations given to most of her family members poke fun at country bumpkin stereotypes. She also had a pet pig named Luanne and a pet hamster named Leslie. She has a horse named Blue Jeans, who came from Tennessee to Malibu to live with Miley and her family. 

 Miley received a love for music from her father, who was a popular country music star. Her parents recognized Miley's potential and gave her a guitar on December 25, 2000.[6] 

 Miley's mother Susan (Brooke Shields) was born April 12, 1969 and died about the time Miley was 10.[citation needed] It was at this time that her father retired from his music career and moved the family to Malibu, California where they live in a four bedroom beach house.[citation needed] 

 By the time she was 13 years old, Miley had become a famous pop star under the stage name """"Hannah Montana."""" She goes to great lengths to disguise herself as Hannah in order to keep her true identity a secret, except to those closest to her. However, in the episode """"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office"""" it is shown that the President of the United States knows her secret. 

 Personal lifeApart from her life as a pop star, Miley leads a very normal life. She is fond of camping[7] and hanging out at the beach, but is not at all athletic.[8] She has a fear of spiders[9] and visiting the dentist.[10] She also occasionally struggles with her school work and her self confidence. She often goes through over-the -top schemes to deal with her problems. 

 SchoolIn the first season, Miley is an 8th grader at Seaview Middle School, and in the second season she enters Seaview High School. She became a sophomore in early episodes in Season 3 and later, a junior during the season before the beginning of Season 4. Despite her father offering her the option of homeschooling, Miley decided to attend Public School in order to be a """"normal kid,"""" a decision she sometimes finds herself regretting.[11] Due to her double life, she is often in awkward positions and is forced to lie in order to keep her secret. 

 Miley's best friends are classmates Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso) who both learn her secret and help her keep it from their other classmates. 

 RelationshipsMiley is especially close with her father, from whom she receives much good advice and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley is shown to be ve",0

 I need help to determine if I am being overly sensitive or if  is being as difficult as I feel he is.  The discussion in question, regarding the anglospeak map, is located on the [commons], and I have also tried to bring it up with him on his commons talk page [Joeldl]. 
 IMHO, he is distorting, and interpreting in isolation, the meaning of what I say, and he is also saying I have said things which I have not. 
 In addition, I feel that he is being argumentative and is making his own survey less than productive. 
 Further, he seems to attack that which he doesn't agree with. 
 Finally, I feel that he may be trying to go this route of a survey on the commons instead of the English_language or file_talk:anglospeak.svg talk pages because he apparently has been going around and around with other users about the map. 
 I can see that he has done a lot on Wiki and he knows the ropes really well.  Whereas, I'm new (mostly inactive) and know very little about the ins and outs of Wiki, and maybe I'm just too sensitive, so I really need a neutral party to help me see the real situation.

 ==St Mary's Church, West Chiltington== 
 Great start here; I'm pleased you've got hold of the church guide, as I haven't come across it yet in any library!  I've added the """"usual"""" books which I know have some material on the church.  I'll start working on it properly tonight when I get home.  I had found a possible DYK hook in my previous researches for this one, but I think the Christ on a Wheel mural might be better than what I had (somebody praising the church with a slightly interesting quote).  I don't know how comprehensive the church guide is in terms of the parish history, but could you check to see if there is any reference to the existence of a Mission Room in West Chiltington Common (the main settlement within the parish)? – I have seen one marked on old OS maps, although it has long since disappeared.  I haven't been able to find out any more about it.  (It may not even have been an Anglican mission room, of course.)

b5ccb773d672463b,"""OK, I'm done reading. I agree it is an excellent article. Unfortunately I see it rather as an essay than a research article. It has lots of points and findings and quotes, but, as my brain works, it is difficult for me to incorporate it here. At least now I know what it says and I may be a helper/double-checker if it will be cited. Now, what I found of  note (and not forgotten yet:-) (bits and pieces on random order): 
 *It seems to be critical of the documentary of Helke Sander. She does not question the facts from the d'tary, but rather its presentation: 
 **She does not deny neither the fact thew Germen women were victims, nor questions the numberr 
 **She counter-agrues Sander's claim that she was """"breaking the silence"""" 
 **she objects to the role the d'tary, by its way of presentation, plays in presenting Germany and its Volk as victims rather than perpetrators (NB: not victims of Soviets, but victims of Reich ; in fact, she notes, raped German women were victims of the collapse of the Nazi Reich rather than of Nazism per se) 
 **the language of d'tary reinforces the Nazi propaganda myth about barbaric Slav/Mongol hordes (e.g., an interview with a """"well-bred, civilized"""" Russian veteran  shows his back, but the one ranting about sexual exploits looks exactly as if from Nazi reels about barbaric Russian POW) 
 **in her opinion the d'tary pretends to put forth the idea that the fate of women is common in all wars, but in a kinda hypocritical way 
 *She notes the fact that the rapes were expected: both predicted by Nazi propaganda as a way to reinforce the morale of the defense and by unofficial decriminalization of non-medial and non-eugenic abortions 
 *the guilt of Russians seems to be reinforced by their """"cultural inferiority"""" (russians did rape, while Americans had chocolate; as if somehow coercion of a deprived woman by a chocolate is somehow morally more superior than direct rape) 
 *The fact that in rape reports Russians all described as Asian/Mongol is explained by the imprinted ideas of both """"Arian purity"""" and Nazi propaganda stereotypes; in particular, Americans rapists were mostly described as Negroes and French as Moroccans 
 *At the same time raper reports invariably included socio-economic reasons, which Grossmann explains as reminiscences of the times of Weimar Republic 
 *As I mentioned, she writes the d'tary did not """"break the silence"""". Immediately post-WWII there was plenty of memoir, and in these rape  was a mundane yet another reality of suffering: destroyed houses, hunger, plunder, etc., a nonnotable part of the """"consumer basket"""", so to say. Of course, in most horrendous cases women committed suicide, but at the same time, at city water pumps women exchanged jokes about stupid Russisch and how to dupe them or about sentimental Russisch easily fascinated by children, etc.   Only in  modern discourse of """"higher civilization"""" rape was singled out. 
 *By German women, Russians were generally classified in two polarized groups, drunk barbarians and cultivated officers (whose consensual sex was sought for as a protection from rape), while Americans were commonly described as primitive and vulgar. 
 *The narrative of German women in a crooked way absolved Russians of  personal guilt: surely one cannot expect different behavior from these drunk primitive barbarians, and allowed women """"to distance  from the horror of their own experience"""" and to """"maintain the conviction of their own superiority"""". 
 *After the postwar mess was a bit cleaned up, the talk about Russian rapes was muted. This has an evident explanation in East Germany, but the same happened in the West, despite the fact that it could have been a handy Cold War propaganda tool 
 *Still the rape story lived on, both in personal communication, and numerously in novel and film, as well as in gov't documents. 
 Well, that's what I memorized.  - üser:Altenmann

 This is going to take a while to accomplish. I suggest we come up with some type of rough outline to follow.    
 :Can an administrator clarify what is being merged? Just the Oxfordian articles listed at the top? All the authorship articles (Baconian, Marlovian, Oxfordian, etc)? All of these into the Authorship article? Both Oxfordian articles into one? So many options were listed in the discussion that I am not sure what has been decided. An administrator needs to clarify this before we can move forward.    
 ::Once we get clarification, I also think it's been made clear that primary anti-Stratfordian texts cannot be used, or at least that's my understanding. This will take a bit longer to set up than just rushing in there with a machete, not that I think anybody is advising such. Meanwhile, I've got one short project left to finish before I can answer your charges against me, so look for my answers sometime tomorrow. I'll probably also answer them in stages, since there are so many of them.    
 ::Start with a summary style main article written in Talk:Shakespeare authorship question/sandbox. All editors should work to provide a full and detailed accounting of the controversy keeping in mind WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:FRINGE. After the article is written, then replace this article and redirect all the other articles unless a clear rationale for a content fork or spinout article is shown to exist while creating that article. As for primary source documents, please keep in mind WP:PSTS.    
 :::It is not at all clear that primary anti-Stratfordian texts cannot be used. WP:PSTS asserts that primary sources may be used, but only with care. And that caveat does not merely apply to anti-Stratfordian texts, it applies to all primary sources, Stratfordian or otherwise.    
 :::::Using primary-source anti-Stratfordian references with care is appropriate. Please try to find external, independent, secondary and tertiary sources to keep the article as neutral as possible.    
 ::::It appears we have an issue with the decision to merge. I opened up a discussion with Wiki founder Jimbo Wales who advised this:

 :::::The """"close"""" I wrote above makes it clear that merging is preferred following the Wikipedia:Content fork guidelines. Developing the article in Talk:Shakespeare authorship question/sandbox is preferred to continuing forum shopping. Thanks.    

 My understanding is that the decision was based on the conclusion that the """"arguments for consolidating articles on alternative authorship hypotheses are stronger than those arguments for keeping them separate,"""" not a straight majority vote.

 It's fantastic that all this info is here, but it's total gibberish. I don't know how many non-experts look at this, but lots of it is of that caliber. Maybe it should have sub-articles for the specifics of things like economics and chemistry. There should at least be better organized paragraphs and sections that follow the mechanics of writing, unlike that neat etymology of """"acid test"""" in the introduction. Lots of the hard science needs explaining, too. These improvements would make wikipedia much more enjoyable for casual users. 

 p.s. I was just trying to find out why gold doesn't easily corrode/ tarnish. Can anyone explain? 

 == Amount of Gold == 

 This article states that all the gold ever produced would fit into a cube, with a volume of 8000 m3. At a density of 19,300 kg/m3, this gives a total gold supply of 1500 tonnes, approximately. Later in the article the world supply of gold is said to be over 3000 tonnes. Why the discrepancy?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Could be that one thing is """"all the gold ever produced"""" (1500 tonnes) and another is the total amount of gold on Earth that can be reasonably extracted? Just guessing.    

 with 8000 m3 the total production would be close to 150,000 tonnes. this is the figure that the world gold council gives as its estimate for total production up to 2001.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by

 :: Thanks Prasangika, in general I agree but you quote at least one wrong fact. The position of Ganden Tripa has little to do with the abbot of Ganden monastery, although it is possible that a former abbot of Ganden can become the Ganden Tripa, provided that he has also acted as abbot of either Gyuto, or Gyume, Tantric College. This has been researched and the detailed procedure for appointment of the Ganden Tripa has now been published on his own article, Ganden_Tripa#Mode_of_Appointment. Nevertheless, whilst being the undisputed holder of the post of """"Supreme Head of the Gelug School"""" and so forth, the Ganden Tripa's only responsibility is said to be to teach; and it is the Dalai Lama alone who appoints the Gelug abbots - including the Gyuto and Gyume abbots from whom all the Ganden Tripas are drawn.

 :::Fair enough. I'll copy quotes in my response; I see your point that while it may be more conversational in the short term, it may not help a permanent record. 

 :::There is a delicate line between OR synthesis, and being objective yet informative. When an editor (OK,me) has direct experience in a subject, and doesn't see a relevant aspect covered in any way, objective or not, I think it's responsible to bring up not personal observation, but reasonable sources. Let me take a totally different subject, such as wound infections with """"flesh-eating bacteria"""" (generally strains of Streptococcus pyogenes). If that article merely reported that someone had come in and put slices of bread on the area, I would consider it responsible editing to find references that represent current medical opinion: surgical debridement and massive doses of intravenous antibiotics. I spent 40 years or so in Washington, including working for the Library of Congress, and I know that neither Democrats nor Republicans are amused by """"stunts"""" (your word, not sourced) in hearings. In this case, my experience was that the effect of stunts really needed to be documented for the general reader. 

 :::Quoting you, """"stunt has a clear and appropriate negative connotation"""".  For most people, it represents a negative and unsourced POV. It was not clear to me, when you made a comment about solemn hearings, if you were or were not suggesting that the solemnity was undesirable. """"Code Pink actions at Plame-Wilson Hearing"""" is descriptive and neutral. """"Actions"""" could include Code Pink representatives, in pink power designer suits, giving testimony to the committee. Actions could include trying to be in every view of the witness. Headings should be neutral. I disagree that """"plays heavy metal at inauguration"""" is more informative than """"actions at inaugurations"""". Headings are not expected to convey information, but to assist people in finding the informative text. In an encyclopedia, they are for indexing, not the eye-catching style of newspapers. 

 :::I will have to reread the Tierney and Perazzo articles in detail; it was not my intent to mislead. Without them in front of me, my recollection is that you are correct that Perazzo didn't directly say anything about Code Pink. What he did talk about, IIRC, was the funding of an umbrella group from which Tierney said Code Pink received funds. The article by Tierney alone was confusing; the two needed to be read together. I may have misread and I will happily say so if rereading gives me that impression. At this time, however, it is my impression that Code Pink receives funding from a source that may have a relevant ideological POV. Quoting you, """"Apparently, both Berkowitz and Tierney misstated their references in a manner prejudicial to CodePink! I'm tempted to make a sarcastic comment..."""" I'd say you did make a sarcastic comment. I hope my understanding of good faith editing is that if I found an inconsistency in your sources, I'd write something along the lines of """"A and B, quoted by Daniel, do not appear to agree with each other or the point that was put in the article.

 Interesting. Much complaint about the few penis and vagina jokes. No complaint about the lethal injection execution (article turns out to be about not-a-human, so it does not count?), only a single complaint about the brief hint of domestic violence (""""kill their spouses"""", gone now)  and no complaint at all in these directions by those complaining hard and long against the sex-related jokes. One wonders about priorities. - Tenebris  

 :Nothing here. It's not about priorities. It's about this being an encyclopedia and this kind of in-house ho-ho simply not being appropiate. I complained about cocks and dicks because that's what I immediately noticed. Do you really imagine that I have time to read through all this juvenile nonsense? If I had noticed frivolous stuff about lethal injections and so on I would have complained about that as well. I happen to be a huge fan of South Park and I am amused by its crude toilet humour. I have also opposed the death penalty and actively championed human rights issues all my long life. There is nothing wrong with my priorities and I don't need lectures and insinuations from fellow editors concerning my perfectly valid objections to this pathetic legalised Anglocentric vandalism of Wikipedia that takes place every April 1st, and which last year hit new standards of indecency and cringing inappropiateness that would never sully South Park.    

 ::Oh dear. I must admit I never thought to see a South Park mention in this context after the Anal Probe Controversy.

In particular, the photograph must be submitted properly, with attention to the copyright requirements.  

 When you add additional information, remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM, the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitable. (Thus, there is generally no purpose in giving permission; it is better to rewrite.)  

 However, there is another problem.  The name you have used includes or refers to the subject of the article, and therefore you must choose another username. As explained in WP:USER, only individuals may edit. When you have a username that is or includes the name of your organization, you imply that you are editing officially, and have a superior right to edit the page.

 == Response by Subwayjack == 
 Hello Wayward, Subwayjack here. Woohookitty makes some valid points, however, not reflective of the whole history. I did make the obnoxious reference to KatefanO as described, I apologized to her personally and on the Talk Page. I was banned and allowed to return. In my frustrations wth the activity in the article and on the Talk Page, I have stated several times that """"I quit"""", so what! Not against the rules. Just venting frustrations. The emails are private and outside of WP. Woohookitty has stated on the Talk Page that I threatened him. When asked for him to post the email and threats, he backed off because he knew it was untrue. As to Sherurcij being a victim of the """"F"""" word, here are a few comments from his Talk Page: 
 :I'm sorry I'm not a radical 14-year-old as I'm guessing you are, but I assure you that vandalizing articles to say Richard Belmar was a guy the US lied and said was a terrorist and kidnapped and illegally detained because George Bush is a Nazi is not helping the world's view of the left-wing. So on behalf of those leftists who would actually like to be taken seriously, please shut the fuck up. 
 Yours truly, Sherurcij  
 ::Two wrongs don't make a right sweetie, didn't your mommy ever teach you that? Sherurcij (talk) (Terrorist Wikiproject)  
 Go fuck yourself white boy. - Darwinek  
 I've never seen Sherurcij even remotely admonished for his baiting people to anger. And this is from Chesschamp21's talk page from Woohookitty: 
 :Subwayjack's comments were more severe than yours. I really just want everyone to take a deep breath and calm down a bit. Woohookitty(cat scratches)  
 I agree, as you stated on Woohookitty's talk page, that I have broken some policies, but what about the above issues and the bias shown by Woohookitty? As you also mentioned, you just did a cursory view of the activity, if everything were put together, perhaps a different POV might occur. Look at Chesschamp's psychotic and personally attacking questions on the Talk Page of Charles whitman, and people want to know why I get upset and want to bannish me? If I am to be singled out and the only one banned, that's fine! I will still consider WP a failed attempt to get the Charles Whitman article anywhere near the credible offering that WP professes to accomplish. I will leave you with a quote from Jonathon Swift which applies directly to the history of the Chas. Whitman article: 
 :Falsehood flies and the truth comes limping after; so that when men come to be undeceived it is too late: the jest is over and the tale has had its effect.  The Examiner, Number 15 (November 9, 1710)Thanks for the listen, Subwayjack! 

 ::Um subwayjack? Who do you think you are fooling. If you go here, you will see that in the edit summary, you said """"Alright CuntfanO, you broke the 3RR rule! Suspend yourself for a few hours and let cooler heads prevail."""". You are a troll. Period. And as people on here know, it takes one hell of alot to get me to block users. You were given many opportunities. You keep saying """"I quit!"""" and then doing lovely things like blanking out other's comments. You've quit about 4 times...even told kate to block you indefinitely and yet you keep trying to come back, as is evidenced here. You claim that you aren't using socks when you clearly are.   
 :::And nothing chesschamp has done has approached what you have done. As soon as you find him calling an administrator a """"cunt"""" (and completely accusing her of violating 3RR when she had not, btw), let me know. And please drop this """"if I'm the only one banned, that's fine!"""" stuff. Come now. if you truly didn't care, then why are you emailing me every other day and posting here? Please. Of course you care and of course you want to be unblocked. Otherwise you wouldn't keep badgering us. You would've just let it go and moved on if you truly didn't care. But Wayward, if you want to block others, go ahead. I was concentrating on jack and I'm not sure how blocking him and not others shows a """"bias"""".

 * Vidalia, Georgia micropolitan area →  
 * Glasgow, Kentucky micropolitan area →  
 – State names are properly set off with commas on both sides.  Article titles must still be grammatical, notwithstanding the inexplicable comment above that """"the second-comma concern applies to prose, not article titles"""".    
 *Oppose both. The grammar with two commas suggests that Vidalia and Glasgow are micropolitan areas, which is not what is meant. With one comma, there is a micropolitan area centered on Vidalia and Glasgow, which is the meaning used. A review of the cats involved shows that one comma is used for this type of article, such as Jacksonville, Illinois micropolitan area.    
 **Your interpretation of the meanings denoted by the two punctuation options is idiosyncratic at best.  The state name is delimited by commas because it is an interruption to the regular flow of the phrase.  Much like one would say """"the British style of government"""" or """"New York state of mind"""", we have a noun phrase (""""micropolitan area"""") being modified by a location (""""Vidalia"""") to form a descriptive phrase (""""Vidalia micropolitan area"""").  It's an area named for or identified by the community """"Vidalia"""".  The state name, here, is used as it is in running prose: """"The man said he was from the Tupelo, Mississippi, area.""""  One would not say """"... from the Tupelo, Mississippi area"""", because one is not talking of a """"Mississippi area"""".  Likewise, we are not speaking of a """"Georgia micropolitan area""""; we're talking of a micropolitan area named for """"Vidalia, Georgia"""".  Thus, the commas are necessary, just as they would be in running prose.     
 *Support both per WP:Copyedit mentioned in the previous RM above.

 This article is not POV or Original reaserch, it is missing very important citations. I have put a fact tag on those sentences for the time being  

 ==Reference to LTTE being terrorist organisation== 
 I have removed this for the second time. The LTTE is banned in many countries. But does this have to be stated in every article in Wikipedia which is in some convoluted way related them? Are the crimes committed by the Sri Lankan Government and Sri Lanka Armed Forces listed in the header section of every article that is in some way related to Sri Lanka? This is just petty propaganda which undermines the purpose of Wikipedia.   

 ==Attempted deportation of M.K. Sivajilingam== 
 I have removed this for the second time. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news agency. The attempted deportation of Sivajilingam is a triviality when compared to many other things that have happened related to the TNA since its creation more than 7 years ago. So why add this to the article? And why in the header section? This, again, is just petty propaganda which undermines the purpose of Wikipedia.   
 :TNA  is noted for its unreserved support of the LTTE which is banned as a terrorist organisation in 31 countries. Hence its claim for notability and therefore mention of it should be made in  its article. Sivajilingam's deportation is noteworthy in itself, as a TNA member of parliment is facing deportation for attempting to solicit support for the banned LTTE in neighbouring india. Hence inclusion of both are valid.

 That's right, Terminal and non-terminal functions only handles CFL (without saying so, as many wikipedia articles do). It is mainly about parse trees and uses some unusual notation (viz. """"function"""", which occurs neither nor the only source , nor in the parse tree article). Maybe a sentence that nonterminal symbols and terminal symbols correspond to interior and leaf nodes in a CFG parse tree, respectively, could be used. And the example from the picture seems more understandable (everyone who learned English grammar might have seen such a tree) than the  example (which doesn't fit the previous grammar definition but uses some unexplained extensions for optionality and repetition). 

 It could look like this (wording subject to improvements): 

  
 . Nonterminal symbols and terminal symbols correspond to interior and leaf nodes, respectively.]] 
 As an example, consider the following context-free grammar for simple English sentences. 
 N = { S, NP, VP, Det, N, V, ... }, 
 Σ = { John, ball, hit, the, ... }, 
 start symbol is S, 
 P is as follows: 

 S   := NP VP | ... 
 VP  := V NP  | ... 
 NP  := Det N | ... | John | ... 
 N   := ball | ... 
 V   := hit | ... 
 Det := the | ... 

 In this example, nonterminal symbols denote grammatical categories, like """"sentence"""" (abbreviated by """"S""""), """"noun phrase"""" (""""NP""""), etc., while terminal symbols are English words, like """"John"""", """"ball"""", etc.

d11000b7ae803457,"""== What about this theory? == 

  
 I'd like to comment on what I've researched on this topic. 

 There are medical conditions associated with nose picking. One is called rhinotillexomania, which is the compulsive picking of the nose, and can sometimes appear with trichotillomania, which is the compulsive plucking of hair or pulling the hair out of ones head, and can manifest in compulsively pulling hair from ones eyebrows, eyelashes, underarms, pubic region, beard, virtually anywhere one has hair. Other such compulsions include skin picking or cutting, eating, nail biting, the list goes on.  Compulsivity can be related to psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Generally people who have such compulsions also experience excessive anxiety and distorted or poor self image and can be prone to suicide. People (including children) with these compulsions also report often feeling worried.  

 Suggested treatment is behavioural therapy [Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Stimulus Control (SC)] combined with SSRI drugs. Because such compulsions respond well to anti-depressant medications, it is fair to assume there is a neurochemical cause. 

 This is just my research on the topic. I'm not a psychologist or any such professionally accredited person, I just read what I could find on the subject, and it's far from a complete synopsis of OCD. If you happen to suffer from this disorder you are far from being the only one, and I'd encourage you to speak to your doctor or a counsellor about this treatable problem. There is lots of info on the net if you need to learn more before you can come forward and help yourself. 

 Mate- that is absolute rubbish.  I know a lot of people who pick their noses habitually and they do not have these disorders.  You sound like a pyschologist with your half-arsed pyscho-analysis.  This isn't an article for scaremongering and pseudo-pyschology.  Stick to the day job.  

 I agree. Almost no one will want to know that, you idiot! 

 This is silly. Let's keep it!  

 : I WAS KIDDING!!! (see ) I was kidding! nooooo (wail of anguish). what the heck. let's keep it.  

 ::I was kidding too (except about the this is silly part). Should we delete the entire article, or what?  

 : well, it covers the subject in a serious manner, with medical links. I'd like to know where the quotations come from.  

 ::Two of the quotations came from well-known folklore and the third, about the furniture, came from a book of ironic aphorisms by a gentleman named Van Lane Ferguson.  Another from that book:  """"If you don't believe you exist, smell under your arms.""""   

 :::A kind correspondent has reminded me that the book is called We Bark at Midnight by Van Lane Ferguson, published by Tuttle.  This talk page is evidently the only place on the www you can find this out.    

 :::: Aoooooooooooooooooouw! Put the quotations back in!  11:43 20 December 2002 (UTC) 

 :::Another quote he sent me, """"I guess being an ordinary, everyday Alabama commonlaw wife just wasn't good enough for Edna.""""  The quote that was censored from the article by a humorless square was, """"I know he picks his nose.  I felt under his furniture.""""  The other two square-censored quotes, not from the book, were, """"How did you know I went to Harvard?""""  """"I noticed your class ring when you picked your nose.""""  And, """"You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.""""   

 :::: I vote for restoring the censored quotes.  They were refreshing and entertaining and interesting.  There's nothing wrong with an encyclopedia that has a bit of panache and cheek to it.  Having serious information is one thing, but being dry and dull is another.  I may just restore those quotes myself.  

 ::This isn't the most serious entry in the Wikipedia, but this is the first time I've been banned to bad jokes, etc.  I put those quotes in, not entirely tongue in cheek, because I thought they gave an indication of the attitudes against nose-picking that society has.

 LOL. Thanks for the laugh!

 ::::::::I don't know and I don't see how that is relevant given that the inclusion rules clearly permit it. Every biography is different but they are all built using the same basic set of rules no matter whether the person is a painter, a politician or anyone else talking about their work and views. If it informs the reader about the subject of the biography and the information has been selected by secondary RS it can, in principal, be included. The relevance to the synth discussion is to show that that there is, in my view, a basic flaw, an inconsistency, in the argument. If 10 things each individually qualify for inclusion then the notion that a single simple meta statement about them is synth and requires another source to demonstrate the importance of the 10 things is illogical. Let me ask you this via a reductio ad absurdum. The article includes the 2 books written by Levy. If I were to add a statement that said """"Levy has written 2 books"""" somewhere in the article would you argue that it is synth, that I need a source that says """"Levy has written 2 books"""" to avoid synth and to demonstrate that the easily verifiable fact that Levy has written 2 books is important enough to mention ?

 == Speech of the Unknown == 

 The Speech of the Unknown details an account of a speech delivered at the signing of the Declaration of Independence by an unknown, non-delegate, in attendance that day.  The speech is often attributed to Saint Germain, a Rosicrucian. 

 The following is taken from Washington and His Generals: or, Legends of the Revolution by George Lippard, published in 1847. The signers of the Declaration of Independence sat in Independence Hall at Philadelphia, contemplating losing their heads or being hanged. Their courage wavered. The document sat there unsigned. An extraordinary catalyst was needed to move them to action. An unknown man rose and gave an electrifying speech. He disappeared soon after. 

 By signing the Declaration, all were guilty of high treason under British law. The penalty for high treason was to be hanged by the neck until unconscious, then cut down and revived, then disemboweled and cut into quarters. The head and quarters were at the disposal of the crown. 

  
 No wonder they wavered! No wonder they discussed back and forth for days on end before signing the document that carried so grave a penalty. An old legend dramatizes the story of the one who galvanized the delegates and gave them the courage to sign that document. 

  
 But still there is doubt–and that pale-faced man, shrinking in one corner, squeaks out something about axes, scaffolds, and a–gibbet! 

  
 """"Gibbet!"""" echoes a fierce, bold voice, that startles men from their seats–and look yonder! A tall slender man rises, dressed–although it is summer time–in a dark robe. Look how his white hand undulates as it is stretched slowly out, how that dark eye burns, while his words ring through the hall. (We do not know his name, let us therefore call his appeal) 

  

 THE SPEECH OF THE UNKNOWN. 

  

 """"Gibbet? They may stretch our necks on all the gibbets in the land–they may turn every rock into a scaffold–every tree into a gallows, every home into a grave, and yet the words on that Parchment can never die! 

  

 """"They may pour our blood on a thousand scaffolds, and yet from every drop that dyes the axe, or drips on the sawdust of the block, a new martyr to Freedom will spring into birth! 

  

 """"The British King may blot out the Stars of God from His sky, but he cannot blot out His words written on the Parchment there! The works of God may perish–His Word, never! 

  

 """"These words will go forth to the world when our bones are dust. To the slave in the mines they will speak–hope–to the mechanic in his workshop–freedom–to the coward-kings these words will speak, but not in tones of flattery. No, no! They will speak like the flaming syllables on Belshazzar's wall– 

  

 THE DAYS OF YOUR PRIDE AND GLORY ARE NUMBERED! 

  

 THE DAYS OF JUDGMENT AND REVOLUTION DRAW NEAR! 

  

 """"Yes, that Parchment will speak to the Kings in a language sad and terrible as the trump of the Archangel. You have trampled on mankind long enough. At last the voice of human woe has pierced the ear of God, and called His Judgment down! You have waded on to thrones over seas of blood–you have trampled on to power over the necks of millions–you have turned the poor man's sweat and blood into robes for your delicate forms, into crowns for your anointed brows. Now Kings–now purpled Hangmen of the world–for you come the days of axes and gibbets and scaffolds–for you the wrath of man–for you the lightnings of God!– 

  
 """"Look! How the light of your palaces on fire flashes up into the midnight sky! 

  
 """"Now Purpled Hangmen of the world–turn and beg for mercy! 

  
 """"Where will you find it? 

  
 """"Not from God, for you have blasphemed His laws! 

  
 """"Not from the People, for you stand baptized in their blood! 

  
 """"Here you turn, and lo! a gibbet! 

  
 """"There–and a scaffold looks you in the face. 

  
 """"All around you–death–and nowhere pity! 

  
 """"Now executioners of the human race, kneel down, yes, kneel down upon the sawdust of the scaffold–lay your perfumed heads upon the block–bless the axe as it falls–the axe that you sharpened for the poor man's neck! 

  
 """"Such is the message of that Declaration to Man, to the Kings of the world! And shall we falter now? And shall we start back appalled when our feet press the very threshold of Freedom? Do I see quailing faces around me, when our wives have been butchered–when the hearthstones of our land are red with the blood of little children?

 This article fails to mention the pardon granted to George Burdick, a New York newspaper editor, who had refused to testify in federal court regarding the sources used in his article concerning the collection of customs duties. He plead the 5th; President Woodrow Wilson then granted him a full pardon for all of his offenses, which he refused. He continued to plead the 5th, at which he was sentenced by a federal judge for contempt. It was then that the Supreme Court reinforced the necessity of accepting a pardon to be valid; the federal judge had imprisoned Burdick on the grounds that he was claiming falsely his need for protection against self-incrimination. 

 In short, this article overlooks a pretty important pardon. Burdick was released on order of the Supreme Court.

 Items deleted recently: 

 During this period, Perle is stated to have been investigated by the Justice Department, and found to have violated US policies relating to unlawful transmission of sensitive classified US information to Israel. """"An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy,"""" (They Dare To Speak Out, Chicago, Ill, Lawrence Hill Books 1989)."""" So far as can be determined, despite allegedly being caught spying for a foreign government, in the process undermining American national security, no action was taken against Perle at the time or later.  

  

 However, allegations of improper conflicts of interest, have nonetheless led to Perle's resignation from various positions. While serving on the Defense Policy Board, he was hired as an advisor for Global Crossing. It is stated """"Even as he advises the Pentagon on war matters, Richard N. Perle, chairman of the influential Defense Policy Board, has been retained by the telecommunications company Global Crossing to help overcome Defense Department resistance to its proposed sale to a foreign firm, Mr. Perle and lawyers involved in the case said today."""" Mr. Perle's fee is $750,000, but he will receive an additional $600,000 if the sale is approved.   

 Perle maintained that he had not violated any ethics rules, but decided to resign his position as chairman of the Defense Policy Board on March 26, 2003, . In an effort to save face, he wrote in his resignation letter that he would refuse any compensation with his deal with Global Crossing and """"any fee for past service would be donated to the families of American forces killed or injured in Iraq."""" There was also a report that """"The communications company, Global Crossing, also announced that Mr. Perle had decided to sever his ties with it.""""   

 As a former Clinton adviser observed with admiration, Perle “enjoys all the benefits of being an insider without any of the constraints.” 

 The Global Crossing affair started a more critical look into Perle's business affairs. On March 29, 2003, The New York Times reported that Perle was involved with Loral Space and Communications in 2001 as an advisor while it faced accusations that it transfered rocket technology to China.  It is worth noting that the Global Crossing affair was also due to Global Crossing trying to overcome Defense Department opposition to be sold to a venture with ties to China. In February 2004, Perle resigned entirely from the Defense Policy Board.  The full text of Perle's resignation letter may be found at the website for the public relations firm Benador Associates.     

 ===SEC singles out Perle for criticism===    

 On August 31, 2004, a special committee of the Board of Directors investigating the alleged misconduct of the controlling shareholders of Hollinger International submitted the 512-page Breeden Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the report, Perle is singled out as having breached his fiduciary responsibilities as a company director by authorizing several controversial transactions which diverted the company's net profit from the shareholders to the accounts of various executives. Perle received over $3 million in bonuses on top of his salary, bringing the total to $5.4 million, and the investigating committee called for him to return the money. Top Hollinger executives dismissed the report and have filed a defamation lawsuit against the head of the investigating committee, former SEC chairman Richard C. Breeden.

372d388312955471,"""Fat cells and fat droplets are not mere passive receptacles of calorie bearing molecules.  They are also active metabolic entities capable of receiving signals. Signals to fat cells may signal them not to store any additional fat, and also to break down the fat already in the cells.  Oleic acid was one fatty acid that appeared to be effective for this signal (1), and olive oil is 85% oleic acid.  A weight loss study used oleic acid in combination with DHA and branched-chain amino acids as a nutraceutical supplement to induce weight loss in humans (2).

 Although epidemiologic evidence and animal studies suggest that olive oil may prevent the onset of cancer, the components responsible for such an effect and their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown... These results support the hypothesis that polyphenols play a critical role in the anticancer activity of olive oil.(Roc’s nutrition page). 
 Skin Care 
 Olive oil has been known for generations not only for its healing qualities but also as a natural, deep penetration moisturizer, regenerating skin cells and softening the tissue.  
 It acts as a natural preservative and antioxidant for the other ingredients in the beauty products, and directly acts as an antioxidant for the skin, protecting it against free radical damage.  

  
 Protection ( at the end of Production): 
 In particular, it is necessary to protect the oil against lipid oxidation which can have many deleterious effects on the quality of virgin olive oil, including the formation of unpleasant organoleptic characteristics, the drastic reduction of the bouquet and taste notes as well as the reduction of naturally-occurring antioxidant compounds and therefore shortening of its the shelf life.  
 Production: 
 The different names for olive oil indicate the degree of processing the oil has undergone as well as the quality of the oil. Extra-virgin olive oil is the highest grade available, followed by virgin olive oil. The word """"virgin"""" indicates that the olives have been pressed to extract the oil; no heat or chemicals have been used during the extraction process, and the oil is pure and unrefined. Virgin olive oils are the healthiest, since they contain the highest levels of polyphenols, antioxidants that have been linked with better health.  

 Nutrition & Current Researches: 
 The US Food and Drug Administration permitted a claim on olive oil labels stating: """"Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons (23g) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.""""  

 Olive oil protects against heart disease as it controls the """"bad"""" levels of LDL cholesterol and raises levels of the """"good"""" cholesterol, HDL.  
 Olive oil is also rich in polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticoagulant actions, which may be another reason why it is important for heart health.  
 The cons Olive oil is light sensitive and must be stored in opaque containers away from heat sources to maintain its quality.  
 Olive oil, like all fats, is high in kilojoules, so should be consumed in moderation. But if you replace the saturated or trans-fats in your diet with olive oil, your kilojoule consumption will remain the same and you will be gaining health benefits.  
 The rats fed with olive oil saw their tumours grow far more slowly than those fed the vegetable oil or the normal diet. The amino acids in the olive oil may help to block a key gene that fuels the growth of cancer cells.  

 pH 
 pH refers to the hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution. Olive oil and other oils are not water soluble so their acidity cannot be measured in terms of pH.  
 Vitamin E (a natural antioxidant): Olives have 1.6mg, or 2.3 IU (International Units) per tablespoon. One tablespoon provides 8% of RDA for vitamin E. 
 Vitamin K: The richest sources of vitamin K are green, leafy vegetables. One serving of spinach or collards, for instance, or two servings of broccoli provide four to five times the RDA. The greener the vegetable, the higher the content, say the researchers, because the vitamin is associated with the chlorophyll. According to the USDA , vegetable oils such as olive oil are the second best source.""",0

 re: your note on my page 

 I am *not* arguing against your statements, but you're changing sourced and cited text to statements. There was, for example a quote on there that had a 'citation needed'. You removed it, stating merely that the wording was correct. That's *not* good enough for an encyclopedia. They were calling for a citation that would actually *support* your arguments; removing it so that people like myself, who go through looking for 'citation needed' notes to cite won't know that the fact needs to be supported. That means, in half a year, when you're on vacation for a month, someone might come across it and say, 'Huh. That's not cited. Out it goes.' 

 While it might feel like a blog or regular website, the point of Wikipedia is to provide knowledge. When you make changes such as referring to the schools as fomenting genocide without citing it, you're not helping the people who will come here looking for information. If you have books, scholarly references, newspapers and such to support your view, we'd LOVE it to be added to the article. My issue has nothing to do with whether its genocide or not, but with uncited things that could be opinions (especially because of their emotional load) being added.

Why are you even having a conversation with these beautiful, amazing, flawlessly reasoned people? After all, isn't it clear that the TTP,  since it was contracted by insurers, is hopelessly biased (as opposed to trial attorneys and their consultants, who have no vested financial interest in tort reform whatsoever, and therefore are free to quote studies as they please?) 

 A slice of advice, my friend - this arguement is completely absurd.  With a straight face, they are arguing that civil trial lawyers and their fundraisers don't have any financial interest in enforcing strict caps on punitive damages and contingent fees, then in the next breath, say that insurers and their countless minions do.   

 (Actually I don't know if they have a straight face.  They may be giggling psychotically.  In a bathtub full of tobbacco money.) 

 The point is, at least one has already admitted to being a trial lawyer, and therefore probably has more money then 6 rooms full of me and you.  She argues for a living, and will argue, inanely and illogically, forever.  Her condescension is emblematic of why we need tort reform.

 ::::My sense is that it is emphatically wrong to say Makemake was classified as a dwarf planet on 11 July 2008.  All that happened on July 11 2007 was that the USGS got a name for the thing from the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN).  They took their existing website, which had Pluto and Eris under the heading """"dwarf planets,"""" and added Makemake under that heading.  Because of the hairsplitty nature of the 11 June 2008 decision on plutoid naming procedures, they probably should have added a line clarifying that Makemake was named by WGPSN under the presumption of eventual dwarf planet/plutoid status.  But they didn't.  Oh well.  Can't blame them, frankly, because it is so hairsplitty. 
 :::::But even if you wanted to fudge the (IMHO, fairly asinine) distinction between """"Dwarf planet"""" and """"Object with H < +1 that we're really, really damn sure will meet the eventual definition of a dwarf planet"""", that would mean Makemake formally became a dwarf planet on June 11, not July 11.  Why?  Because that's when this release was made, setting out the H < +1 parameter.  It would also mean  is a dwarf planet. 
 ::::The gazetteer only lists named objects, not those with provisional designations.  Things get added to that site as they get names, not as they are classified, not as they are confirmed to exist, not as they are discovered.  It makes no reference, for instance, to S/2003 J 10.  Why?  Because it isn't a moon?  No, because it doesn't have a name yet.  It makes no reference to  either.  Does that mean it's any more or less of a dwarf planet than Makemake is?  No.  Just that it's a body without a name. 
 ::::Finally, it's incorrect to say that the USGS has an IAU cite of Makemake's status as a dwarf planetthe IAU links under the dwarf planets heading have nothing to do with the case of Makemake specifically because they all date from March 2006.

 :The stereotypes listed in the Black stereotype page are listed, but many go unsourced. Apparently, as it appears in the article, sources are not required to implicate Blacks are often portrayed as “athletic,” “unintelligent,” “very religious,” “poor,” “musically talented,” or “criminals,” but to say Whites are racist, conservative, capitalist, in favor of White privilege, and consider their race “the normal race” somehow requires sources, or is considered """"original research."""" Stereotypes are born based on people making generalizations about a social group concluded from inferences, often formed from a significant amount of observations involving the senses. People then use those generalizations to “define” the subjected social group, which becomes the stereotypes per se. Nonetheless, the fact of the matter is stereotypes are only true to the people that fit the stereotypes, which is never the entire group. If the entire group shared the stereotype, apparently, they would not be called stereotypes, but rather facts or the truth. Thus, obviously, because people generalized Blacks as athletic, unintelligent, religious, poor, etc. from their personal experiences, those observations became stereotypes. In other words, a source isn’t required to implicate something born as a result of personal experience, since stereotypes are not factual nonetheless, and naturally, we know those stereotypes do exist for Blacks.  

 :A stereotype is based on the significant number of people that “defines” a group with a characteristic based on empirical generalizations. Knowing that, I’m Black, and many other non-Whites, even many Whites, can agree these stereotypes in the article are appropriate stereotypes attributed to Whites. For example, the criminal stereotype regarding Blacks only applies to the Black people that are actually criminals. In this case, the only Whites that vote in favor of White privilege are the ones that do so. The only Whites that are racist and support White power, nationalism, and/or supremacy are the ones that do so. Knowing that, note this; people, mainly non-Whites, do attempt to define Whites as “racist” in all those instances, as White privilege supporters, and etc., which makes them appropriate stereotypes. Many of those racists do complain about social hazards committed by Blacks, but mostly, just ridicule it, see it as a problem, or discuss it on discussion boards and such, yet, do nothing to help solve the problem. The stereotypes about non-Whites are based upon what Whites think and generalize about them. Well, in the case of White stereotypes, it’s mainly viewed as what non-Whites think of or generalize about Whites. 

 :Merely because it’s not from a White perspective doesn’t mean it isn’t valid or shouldn’t be considered. Thus, why does this article speculate “original research” when many people can agree these stereotypes are attributed to Whites? If you want citations to “prove” these are actually considered stereotypes, any hopes of locating them are slim, for minorities are oftentimes stereotyped negatively compared to Whites because Whites are mainly doing the stereotyping, as they see themselves as the normal race, and minorities as """"other."""" In other words, as they're """"normal,"""" they sit back and watch the """"others"""" """"misbehave."""" Because each race is different and have various characteristics that are nearly """"exclusive"""" to them, the generalizations about them based on how they """"misbehave"""" become stereotypes that are nearly """"exclusive"""" to the subjected racial group.  

 :Therefore, minorities are oftentimes stereotyped negatively. The positive stereotypes for White people are generally based on comparisons Whites use when negatively stereotyping minorities. However, when a non-White (or sometimes even a White person) stereotypes White people in a negative way, because the majority of internet users and Wikipedians are White Americans, stereotypes aimed at Whites (that can be considered offensive) often get deleted, since we can agree that people, no matter their race, do not want to be stereotyped in a negative fashion. Check out the earlier versions of this article to see. Trivial stereotypes such as, for example, “White people can’t dance,” was (I think) first addressed by Eddie Murphy, a Black person. Ever since, the stereotype became widespread and accepted in White and Black comedy. Possibly offensive ones however, such as racism, gets taken off. Whether or not people do not want to be stereotyped, or if it's considered """"original research"""" based on findings that probably don't exist and never will, non-Whites still have their generalizations and stereotypes about White people, so they should remain in this article and be considered.

  I just shared with 'Gaba' my views on what I think the tension might be in my edits regarding Global Warming Controversy. I was interpreting the article to be a balanced presentation of the arguments for and against Anthropogenic Global Warming. However, it would seem, as recent edit reversions would suggest, the article is about presenting the resolved scientific consensus regarding Anthropogenic Global Warming, and the scientific arguments opposing Climate Skepticism. This for me at least seems to be a drift away from a purely neutral presentation of the Global Warming Controversy, with the article making a relatively poor presentation of the Climate Skeptics' viewpoint.  

 I think maybe there is slight tension in the article title, Global Warming Controversy.  

 My suspicion is there would be a number of people coming to the article to get a reasonable articulation of each side of the debate, but they might be a little bit disenchanted with what is presented. 

 My suggestion and solution therefore, would be that wikipedia develop a separate, genuine article focused on 'Climate Skepticism'. That way wikipedians wouldn't have to exhaust themselves with NPOV arguments regarding the presentation of a Climate Skeptic's POV.  

 At the moment a wiki search for 'Climate Skepticism' is re-directed to 'Global Warming Controversy' which leaves the reader wanting for a better articulation of the minority viewpoint of the Climate Skeptics.  

 So what do you think??? 

 A new article dedicated to discussing Climate Skepticism would be much more useful in my humble opinion....rather than people getting stuck in endless debates about NPOVs....???

 :Got your message.  Thanks for the note; as it happens, I have the Fairfield article on my watchlist, so I'd have seen your comments and edits anyhow.  (If you're not familiar with the watchlist, it's a good way to monitor pages for changes; you can add and remove pages from it manually, or you can set """"My preferences"""" so that every page you edit is automatically added to it.) 

 :And, while I'm dispensing advice: Notice how this comment is indented from the one above it.  That's done by putting a colon at the beginning of each paragraph (you can see it in this case if you switch into edit mode).  Additional colons produce additional indentation, and that makes it easier to keep track of who's saying what in a talk-page discussion.  (I've edited the talk page for Fairfield to indent your response from my original comment; if I add something further, I'll put two colons in front of it to indent it even further.) 

 :Now, to your remarks re. the Fairfield photos.  I'm afraid I have to chide you a bit on your assumption that I was vandalizing the article.  One of the core tenets of Wikipedia is """"Assume good faith"""".  Of course, there are situations that're clearly vandalism, but if there's any room for doubt, WP:FAITH.  That goes double if the editor in question has a record of non-vandalism.  If you'd checked my user contributions (click on """"Ammodramus"""", then find """"User contributions"""" under """"Toolbox"""" at left), you'd have seen that I've contributed a great deal of non-vandalizing content to articles on Nebraska, including adding photos to the articles on several hundred Nebraska towns.  Moreover, from my first reversion of your edit, I added an edit summary, which isn't the usual practice among vandals.  When I saw your removal of the photo without an edit summary, I was inclined to suspect vandalism on your part; however, when I checked your user contributions, I saw that you'd made useful contributions in the past, so were probably not engaging in deliberate vandalism this time. 

 :I have to disagree with """"it is not good etiquette to remove someone else's photo and replace it with your own. ADDING a photo to the page is one thing, but removing my photo was inappropriate. In the future, please refrain from removing other people's images from Wikipedia entries.""""  From the standpoint of Wikietiquette, changing or removing a photo is no different than changing or removing text.  As with text edits, one should add an edit summary, and the change is of course subject to discussion, reversion, further changes, etc.; but there's no presumption that the original photo is necessarily the best one. 

 :I'll justify my photo change at the article's talk page.  Thanks again for the note letting me know about your comment there.  I hope you don't mind my offering you advice; my hope was to help and encourage you, since we need more editors working on Nebraska, especially outstate Nebraska, subjects.

 == Proposed change == 

 I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climatic models, and proposed corrective actions. This proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner?   

 Although the terms """"global warming"""" and """"global cooling"""" can be used to describe cyclic variations in global temperature, the term """"global warming"""" has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0.74°C(ref)NOAA Global Warming FAQ(/ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.  

 Predicted impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glaciers; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes; and changes in agricultural yields. 

 The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcanos, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. 
     

 :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (""""can be used"""") adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0.74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to misread """"late 1800's"""" as 1800. I'm not really happy by the """"warming is predicted by organizations"""" - many individual scientists do so as well. """"permafrost and sea ice"""" are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). """"Fairly rapid"""" is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be """"is"""", not """"has been"""". I like the """"attributed in large part"""", but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red herring here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the """"imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system"""" - what would that system be?  Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (""""human-caused, no action"""" (I think Lombog now falls into that group), """"human caused, action"""" (many there), """"not human-caused, no action"""" (strict deniers), and even """"not human caused, action anyways"""" (e.g. from people who are concerned about energy resources).    

 :: Me either, for all of Stephan's reasons, plus (A) I dislike bulk changes and prefer you take smaller bites so we can zero in, (B) by starting this new thread you are sort of whitewashing the fact that you tried to win a consensus to do a major overhaul along these lines in your prior thread titled """"observations"""", and you failed to win that consensus, (C) I'm unwilling to embrace bulk edits by someone who admits they don't understand basic terms and can't supply citations for the changes they wish to make, as you admitted in that prior thread.

The truth is, what some idiots perceive as a cabal of corrupt admins is actually a group of by-and-large responsible editors who the aforementioned idiots pick fights with, and then complain about when they lose.  You're being quite uncivil, and that's a recipe for disaster - go find a successful complaint against an admin, and try to find a single harsh word.  I'm not saying you're an idiot.  But you're going down a path that anyone can tell you won't end well. 

 :Pal, right now you're at a crossroads:  You're on the threshold of breaking about half a dozen behavioral guidelines.  And you're alleging admin abuse, so that's not going to go unnoticed.

 Hi Xiong 

 You say: 
 <> 
 Well, you just re-descovered what the early sages understood all the way when they invented words like """"intelligence"""". This word comes from the latin """"inter"""" (which can be translated in english as both """"among"""" and """"between"""", but between in the sense of """"friedship between us"""" and not like in """"the space between the trees""""), and """"legere"""" which can also be translated in several ways like """"to gather"""" and """"to select"""", but """"to select"""" like """"all 10 were selected"""" and not like in """"i had to sellect between them"""". Even further down the etymology road of """"legere"""" there's the Greek """"legein"""" which can be translated in english as """"to gather"""". 
 The very process of intelligence was very well understood - and exemplary synthesized in a word - by those ancient minds that created the word for it: to make conections between things. This is the trye-to-its-histor meaning of the word """"intelligence"""", and this is what you discovered also. 

 PS 
 As an almost hilary note, if you'll try to look for the meaning of the word """"intelligence"""" in english dictionaries you will occasionally find definitions that try to go back to its roots, but once it gets there, just about all explanations stumble into """"making the right choice between"""". Which is exactly what such a definition of """"intelligence"""" didn't do -)) They chose the wrong english interpretation for both """"legere"""" (they took it to be """"to selecte"""" like in """"select between"""") and """"inter"""" (they took it like in """"space between the trees"""" instead of """"friendhip between us""""), and those definition come up with the definition """"intelligenec = to make the right choice"""" (which is obviously idiotic since there is no moral aspect involved in defining the word """"intelligence"""" (linke in their """"the *right* choice"""") 

 PPS 
 You say you strongly believe there's nothing to be done to save Wikipedia. 
 I *almost* concur with you, especially for as long as narrow-minded self-sufficient-looking individuals like  have any word to say on it. However, there is one thing that people like you and me can do: we can accelerate it's destruction. Just like (i'd guess) you and I were one of those seed-of-exponential-exposure-growth, we can now do the same to advocate its destruction. 
 IMHO there's ONE SINGLE BIG PROBLEM with this project, but it's at the top level: It's not run by Stallman and The Gang. Well, wanna join in trying to bring him on board and do the real thing this time? 
 Heck, think about it this way: Every single person that we would like to join our effort will join based on like-mindedness, and they (obviously) still have every article they posted on wikipedia, as for the ones that will consider idiotic an effort to build the real thing (as we thought in the beginning wikipedia should be), well we don't need them.

I made NO judgements about ANY of the POV's of any counter-criticisms I cut and I mean NO Offense here.  I hope to see them ALL included in a section that is relevant such as maybe Responses to criticisms of feminism or whatever.

 I did add one little statement of (child abuse/parental abuse) content to one criticism because I happened, by coincidence, to have done the research for another article but I am not a member of that group, nor do I back that criticism as mine...I just saw it was relevant to that criticism and it may well need to be cut too unless THEY use it to back THEIR claims.

Historically having grown up in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, queer was a sexuality slur. Tranny or shemale was a slur against me. I've been called queer, a fag, and a tranny many times in my life. Queer and fag were sexuality slurs. 

 There is a large section of straight trans men and women who distance themselves from the LGBT movement because of the queer washing of all gender minorities.

 == Recent edits by Brian Dell == 

 I do not understand the basis for the following recent edits. , perhaps you can explain them without the personalization and accusations of bad faith. Please interlineate your responses. 
 *  (edit summary: """"you are cherry picking here, Doc. The majority of the material is Dept of Defense files. That should be acknowledged here if you are going to say what the material was about"""")  The material you deleted as been in the lead for some time. I didn't add it; I merely moved it. Now the lead doesn't say that Snowden revealed surveillance programs, which is obviously what he's best known for. If you want something in there about the DoD, then we can probably work something in there. But deleting the whole sentence doesn't seem productive.    
 *  (edit summary: """"doing your best to try and whitewash the chronology via selective omission, I see. This is the true chronology, Doc."""")  Some of your additions have nothing to do with anything I did, and others re-added material that isn't sufficiently noteworthy of the lead. Snowden's specific contractor roles and the precising timing of the State Department's revocation of his passport are simply not essential facts for a 4-paragraph biography of the man.    
 *  (edit summary: """"I thot you thot the lede was too long, DrF? If you can find the length to tack on a one-sided political statement, the space could be found to reported undisputed facts like Snowden's meeting with Russians in HK"""")  You removed reliably sourced content explaining that three courts have ruled on the legality of the telephone metadata program, not two. As written, the lead is misleading because Judge Pauley's decision was reversed by the Second Circuit.   """,0

 == Cor de burro quando foge == 

 I have edited this into the article, hoping you won't remove it as """"original research"""". First, """"burro"""" means 'ass', not 'donkey' (jumento, jerico or jegue, in Portuguese). Burro is the male hybrid of a donkey and a mare. The female is a mula (mule). Actually the phrase does not refer to an undetermined colour, but to a colour that CANNOT be determined (since the ass has gone away). It is a humorous definition of infalsifiability. Moreover, equine colours in Portuguese are a mess, with a myriad terms that vary in definition from region to region and from animal to animal (a """"baio"""" horse is not the same color as an ass of the same color). This adds difficulty to know the actual colour of a burro unless the animal is present.   """,0

 == Disambiguation == 

 Hi. Just a reminder of the thread at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)#Consistency issue. I think all the editors there are willing-to-be-convinced; we just need some specific and representative examples to keep the discussion focused. I suggested the long blue (disambiguation), but anything long should be suitable. 

 Thanks.

 ::Could you respond at the thread itself? Just replying to me on your own talkpage won't further the discussion!  

 ::If you could edit a long disambiguation page (such as Mercury (the example currently used in the guideline), or Blue (disambiguation)) into the style that you would recommend (with a diff link showing the changes), that would probably be the most clear&efficient; way to communicate your thoughts to everyone.

 I've left a question or two for you .    

 :Some deletions now have gone on, on that page. You did write there: Sorry, FT2, this block was not at all transparent. I did ask Charles to comment, but he is apparently off wiki for a time. I am not accepting your pro forma answer as to how he found this. I'd like him to say how he found out about this incident, because that may shed light on why this block happened. There simply isn't good evidence here to show outing, or a pattern of harassment. The evidence should be placed before the block, so as not to leave people guessing. Please don't wheel war over this, folks. Take it to WP:AN and discuss the matter to achieve consensus.  

 :I was offwiki at 1 am UK time, yes. Where is the issue of """"transparency"""" in WP:HARASS, by the way? The wording on """"attempted outing"""" is quite clear and unequivocal. There is no required process at all, and I don't know why you think WP:AN has jurisdiction over the matter, over and above individual admin discretion. I'm aware of two previous incidents where  has used off-wiki identity information """"casually"""" in debates. We were already discussing Mathsci's disruptive conduct relative to other incidents, on the ArbCom list, when I became aware of this event. While we didn't want to act disproportionately before, it seems clear that Mathsci is clueless when it comes to exactly those matters the harassment policy addresses. The block was not disproportionate to the history, and the idea that it must be lifted within hours without giving me any chance to put a fuller case is a ludicrous example of wheel-warring.    

 ::  You are aware that I had the technical ability to unblock Mathsci, but I chose not to do so, and instead asked you for explanations.  I have been trying to help Mathsci be a better editor.

 Both names are not """"correct or acceptable"""" when one name is used as a default; """"Chaotix"""" is the name used for all regions, including any English-speaking one, no exceptions. The only reason so many sources use """"Knuckles' Chaotix"""" is because they don't go by the game itself, which is simply wrong by any metric, and it's one of the many things that calls their title-fact-checking into question (I'd start a list, but WP:VG has made it very clear that they refuse to deal with the situation no matter how much proof I have).

Po čemu sam ja odbacio sud u Hagu? Po čemu i jedna moja promjena niječe bilo što izrečeno na Haškom sudu? Za Blaškićevu presudu nisam nigdje rekao(ajde pročitaj još jedamput moje riječi!) da nije bilo zločina u Ahmićima, niti sam na nijedan način uopće spomenuo ulogu RH u cijelom sukobu. Rekao sam da se držiš izjava iz Haga bez da ih dokazuješ. Bilo je žalbi u kojima su prijašnje osude odbačene. Npr. Kupreškići. Ali sve od toga je totalno ne bitno za moje promjene! Ima 5 stvari koje uporno briseš(po 555put) 
 1) HDZ je pobjedio u većini općina koje je htio uključiti u HB (imaš rezultat izbora na linku) 
 2) za odcjepljenje i organiziranje nove vlasti je krivio neučinkovist vlasti u Sarajevu. U čemu je problem? Koja nova vlast (pogotovo ako je pučistička) ne krivi staru za sve probleme??? 
 3) HB je proglašena republikom za vrijeme Ženevskih pregovora u kojima se raspravljalo o podjeli BiH na 3 etničke republike. Plan Owen-Stoltenberg? Zar bi svaki pojedini pojam morao imati neki link? (a i linkovi koje sam ti dostavio očito nisu prekorisni jer kada si me tražio rezultate izbora, kasnije si tako i tako izbrisao rečenicu i rekao da rezultatiuopće nisu bitni (zašto si me onda tražio izvore???)) 
 4)priče o početku rata. Rat se rasplamsao nakon što je Travnički kanton dodijeljen Hrvatima i HVO pokušao očistiti A BiH iz njega, tj sukobi oko zajedničkih vojnih snaga (wance-owenow plan) 
 5)oko upotrebe simbola i novca. Na sve te simbole Hrvati su imali pravo kao konstruktivni narod, a što se novca tiče, glavna valuta je tijekom rata bila njemačka marka. Siljenje učenika drugih naroda da se pridržavaju hrvatskog kurikuluma je protuustavno, ali nisam imao vremena da to pravilno formuliram. 
 Nijedna od ovih stvari nije išla na štetu niti bosanske vlasti niti u opravdavanje HBa. Sve stvari opisuju stanje kakvo je bilo na području HBa, od naseljavanja izbjeglica pa na dalje. Jedina stvar koja bi eventualno mogla biti sporna je dio o 'hrvatskom strahu' ali to također još nema ispravnu formulaciju. Svaka promjena je u skladu s NPOV wikipedinom politikom, a ne vidim zašto bi za svaku od ovih stvari morao postojati konkretan link! Minimalno 10 puta sam te pozvao da mi pomogneš oko formulacije svake od navedenih stvari umjesto da ih samo obrišeš! O kakvom doljevanju ulja na vatru govoriš? Ajde daj pročitaj još jedanput NPOV politiku [], da li u njoj piše da smiješ citirati tuđe mišljenje, bez da se slažeš s njime???  Dio sa generalizacijom hrvatskog mišljenja je možda moja greška, ali nikako ne uspjevam naći ispravnu formulaciju za situaciju u kojoj 80-90% biračkog tijela bira pripadnike jedne stranke čije je službeno mišljenje takvo i takvo! Prepucavanje i flip-flop oko neke stranice ne vodi apsolutno ničemu, a pogotovo ne koristi wikipedije. Mislim, koja ti je stvar vraćati sve na staro usprkos svakom dokazu? Na samom početku diskusije si me tražio izvore za rezultate izbora 1990, ja ti ih pošaljem, a ti svejedno izbrišeš rečenicu za koju si tražio potkrijepu?? Ajde molim te probaj malo to pročitati i razmisliti o svemu rečenomu. Niti jedna od mojih namjera nije bila loša niti služi za nametanje tuđeg mišljenja, niti opravdanju HBa(milijunti put!) već proširenju konteksta. I ne shvaćam zašto pričaš o izjavama iz bosanskih medija, niti kako bi nešto bilo drugačije da navedeš, makar kao izvor neku od tih izjava. Koja je razlika između rečenice 'the Herzeg-Bosnian leadership is presently awaiting trial at the ICTY on charges including Crimes Against Humanity' i navođenja konkretne optužbe za zločin? Svaki zločin bez obzira na nacionalnost treba biti kažnjen. Zar su crvena krvna zrnaca nekog zato što je jedne nacionalnosti imuna na ratne zločine??

 Hi Hectorian -) You must understand that Pontus did not exist among ancient historians till the creation of the Pontian kingdom by Mithridates I. Then Pontus was simply considered a section of the region of Cappadocia, under whose administration it fell. The northern part of Cappadocia was called Cappadocia Pontica, from which Pontus. While there were a few Greek colonies on the Pontian coast (Trebizond, Sinop) these staunchly resisted the kings of Pontus; Sinop fell only in 183 BC, Trebizond with Mithridates VI. Everything that is known of hellenistic Pontus (pretty little) confirms that it was a semi-barbarian kingdom, where no coins were minted at first, and after (till Mithridates VI) very few. It was far more behind than Bithynia, where hellenization started much earlier and in progressed a much stronger way. As for Pontus, hellenization started to gain strength with the conquest of Sinop (183 BC) and especially Mithridates VI (120 BC). This is what I gained from my sources. Ciao!",0

  alternative move suggestion discussion started (see below).    
 [[:Genesis creation myth]] → Creation according to Genesis — The article was the most Stable under this name, Secondly if the first thing we have to say in the introduction is a defense of how """"it is neutral""""; than odds are it is not neutral.

 * Support The article was the most Stable under this name, Secondly if the first thing we have to say in the introduction is a defense of how """"it is neutral""""; than odds are it is not neutral Current title seems to be a POV-push of how it is just myth; whether or not it is a myth or not in academia. It is unacetable to label something held as sacred to half the world (Jew+Christian+Muslim), This is not Censorship but common sense. The instability of This article since i think an acceptable middle ground would run something like 

 """"Creation according to Genesis refers to the text found in the opening two chapters of the book of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible. This text has been identified as a creation myth by scholars,[1] and has religious significance for Christians and Jews."""""""" (AFA Prof suggest two months ago)    

 * OPPOSE """"Creation according to Genesis"""" implies reality, it is inaccurate and in disharmony with other articles about other creation myths. This article is not religious propaganda. We have already discussed this at great length and we will not have a small minority of editors force their ideology down everybody's throats.  . 
 :: According to Genesis is just what it is. if people want to take Genesis and take it as literal fact that is their prerogative.

The Ukrainian version is more interesting, and is focused on, but it's unique cultural connotations do not exist in other languages (we have nothing like that either in Britain or in the English language) and that's why it deserves to be an article.

 ==Possible directions for article improvement== 

 * It's important to mention that many war correspondents, historically, have been heavily censored. Governments are inconsistent as to what information is allowed and when, so there should be some perspective on where censorship was unusually harsh or lax. Some war correspondents are political mouthpieces for a government or a political faction. An example that comes to mind is McArthur """"landing twice"""" on the Philippines so the cameras could get better shots of him. 

 * Sometimes war correspondents act as investigative journalists, but that may not be any more effective, because military organizations are often sheltered from questions they disapprove of. 

 * War correspondents may not be """"lucky"""" about they see. Richard Tregaskis became hugely successful for """"Guadalcanal Diary"""", where he was in a very important battleground, but in the Cold War era, less notable happened to him, and his books had less impact and are not well remembered. (There's a war correspondent book called """"Assignment to Nowhere"""". Yep. Just about nothing happened.) 

 * A small section should mention war correspondents who caused problems, or who, one way or the other, misrepresented the situation (outside of censorship). Examples are the BBC leaking important information in the Falklands, a couple near misses in WWII, and...for example...the Pulitzer Prize winner Eddie Adams, who later felt guilty for a famous photo of a Vietnamese execution that turned out to be other than what he thought. 

 * Some material in the section that was deleted, about war correspondents """"dirtying themselves up"""" to have a better camera appearance should be brought back, if there is appropriate cited material. 

 One way to proceed would be to quote from published works of the correspondents themselves, when they discuss their job situation.

 മുതലാളി പോയതോടെ അസിസ്റ്റന്റ്‌ നാട്ടുകാരോട്‌ പറഞ്ഞു: നോക്കൂ, ഈ കൂടുകളില്‍ നിറയെ കുരങ്ങന്മാരുണ്ട്‌. കുരങ്ങൊന്നിന്‌ മുത്തപ്പഞ്ചു രൂപ തന്നാല്‍ ഞാനിത്‌ നിങ്ങള്‍ക്ക്‌ തരാം. മുതലാളി വന്നാല്‍ നിങ്ങള്‍ക്കിവയെ അന്‍പത്‌ രൂപക്ക്‌ വില്‍ക്കാം. ചുളുവില്‍ പണം കിട്ടാനുള്ള മാര്‍ഗം തുറന്നുകിട്ടിയ ഗ്രാമീണരില്‍ ചിലര്‍ വീടും പറമ്പും താലിമാലയും വരെ വിറ്റ്‌ കുരങ്ങന്‍മാരെ വാങ്ങിക്കൂട്ടി. മുപ്പത്തഞ്ചു രൂപക്ക്‌ കുരങ്ങന്‍മാരെയെല്ലാം വിറ്റ്‌ തീര്‍ന്നതോടെ അസിസ്റ്റന്റ്‌ തടി തപ്പി. മങ്കി മുതലാളി വരുന്നത്‌ കാത്ത്‌ കുരങ്ങന്‍മാരെ കൂടുകളിലാക്കി കാത്തിരുന്ന ഗ്രാമീണര്‍ വിഡ്ഢികളായി. അയാളുടെ പൊടിപോലും ആ വഴിക്ക്‌ പിന്നെ കണ്ടില്ല. അഞ്ച്‌ കാശിന്‌ കൊള്ളാത്ത കുരങ്ങന്മാരെ മുപ്പത്തഞ്ച്‌ രൂപ കൊടുത്ത്‌ വാങ്ങേണ്ടി വന്ന ഗ്രാമീണരില്‍ ചിലര്‍ ആത്മഹത്യ ചെയ്യുന്നതോടെ 'സ്റ്റോക്ക്‌ മാര്‍ക്കറ്റ്‌' കഥ പൂര്‍ണമാകുന്നു.

 Dear Nichalp, Saravask, Sarvagnya, AJIndia, Indianstar, Chanakyathegreat, Nobleeagle, Ragib,  

 I am once again appealing to you to not allow this racially inferior British bastard writer and filthy mongrel Fowler&fowler; to allow his British dominating POV writings to appear in the India page. I suggest that you all physically bring him to India and hang him to death. This racially inferior drinker of filthy Queen Elizabeth's urine has been relishing during the block periods with discussion articles like 'Fowler&fowler;'s High Handed Reverts' and 'My Edits'. Motherfucking bastard has also been only looking after the British context. 

 I am once again saying that the British has to be denigrated while maintaining historical accuracy. I am not gonna allow this racially inferior British dog to put in his views so easily.  

 I would also like to say that this page is about India since 5000 yrs not just some stupid 100 yr chapter on British India. So please ponder on this.

 OK Crvena Zvezda is a club in Serbia but have roots from there brothers Turkey! 

 OK Crvena Zvezda  is a team volleyball club from Belgrade, Serbia. Currently, OK Crvena Zvezda competes in the Serbian First League of Volleyball.They are biggest joke in Serbian history!They never won shit, that's why everyone makes fun of them.Rival Partizan is waaaaaaaaaay better then them in every sport, that's why they cry and they're always depressed!Every time they lose they blame it on the referee, because they won't admmit that they just suck! 

  

 Cleo se kleo 
 This summer one player from Brasil was tricked to come to FK Secanja, they told him about Bari and Tokyo, but they forgot to tell him that, that was 19 years ago.He signed the contract, and when he came to Belgrade he saw what he's done.FK Secanja was broke,they didn't have food, the poor guy was starving.But then he realised that bigger club was on the other side-FK Partizan Belgrade.He's gonna sign a contract with them and now he has food and money.FK Secanja fans became pissed off and got back to being depressed again.Now Partizan fans sing to gypsis """"Cleo se kleo da me je voleo, a Cleo se kleo da me je voleeeeeeeoooooooo""""

Dule!After 8 titles in a row Partizan fans joke about it, they say """"Dule Vujosevic needs to marry KK Sledeca Sezona...He's f****ng them for 8 years now"""".To soften gypsis pain when Dule is f****ng them, Grobari made Dulex, a new condom to easy the pain of neighborhood girl! 

  
 Gypsis 
 They cry, whine, it's always the referee fault, they smell, they have complex of Grobari(Real Serbians), Gypsis are albanians half and half Croats,The founder of FK Secanja was Krcun, murderer of Serbs.That's why gypsis in last eternal derby they had Torcida flag on """"Sever"""".

 ==Great Britain== 
 figure for great britain is too low. other wikipedia articles agree it is the 8th largest as does times world atlas. 
 84000 sq. miles is nearer. Perhaps someone has subtracted the water area which is still on the island? 

 I'm curious where Sicily and Cyprus would fit into this list. How far would it have to be extended to include those?   

 If one considers Australia and Antarctica to be islands why not also include Eurafrasia (81,163,215 km²) and The Americas (37,785,238 km²)? Just a thought...   

 I agree with you, but it might take a while before the main editors of wikipedia see it that way.   

 There's inconsistency in describing islands of the UK, e.g. Barra, Sheppey and Shetland Mainland among others are described as being in the United Kingdom, whereas Skye and Mull (and others) as being in Scotland, the Isle of Wight in England, and Anglesey/Ynys Mon as being in Wales. As all the other islands just have their national location rather than subnational (e.g Maui is described as being in the United States and has the US flag next to it rather than being described as being in Hawaii and having the Hawaiian state flag depicted), for consistency within the article they should all be changed to United Kingdom.  
    

 :Agree - I've made this change, but (hopefully) to prevent it being changed back, I've said e.g. """"United Kingdom (specifically Scotland)"""".     

  
 Did anyone make sure the figures for the continents are actually only mainland?   
 : I don't think these numbers belong here anyway. It is a list of islands, not of landmasses. Does anyone vote for keeping them?  
 :: I vote to keep - the distinction between landmasses and islands is essentially arbitrary and if the figures are accurate they should stay for comparison's sake.   
 ::I also vote to keep, same reasons.  

 -Yeah.  I'd say keep the land mass figures for sure.  But make sure that they are only the areas of the mainlands, as they are analogous to islands. 

 ::Vote to keep too. Warofdreams states the case for inclusion well.   

 Does anyone know where the figures came from, and how accurate the source is?  My atlas gives slightly different figures for most large islands, and also lists Great Britain as larger than Victoria Island.   22:41 BST 21/8/04 
 :The areas for the smaller islands (below rank 100, the ones I've added) come from various sources.  Some come from the Wikipedia articles, some from consensus on various websites or from official websites, and many from http://users.erols.com/jcalder   
 : I added islands 28 to 100 and the values come from http://users.erols.com/jcalder/index.html, too.   

 :My source is a Philip's Concise World Atlas, and there's occasionally quite large discrepancies between what it lists and what's here eg Celebes is given by Philips as 189,000sq km/73,000sq mi, and by the current article as 174,600 sq km/67,400 sq mi.  I don't have any other printed sources to hand so can't check if Philip's is wrong.  Anyone else? 

 :Also, just occurred to me, isn't Celebes called Sulawesi these days? 

 :  

 I'd be a bit more careful about the atlases you use. I just found a dandy gaffe in the page: The figures made Great Britain bigger than Victoria, going by km², but vice versa going by sq mi. I have corrected this, as every other source I've ever consulted made Great Britain #8 in the world. 

 Also, I'm for ditching the sq mi figures. Only one country of any importance uses those anymore, and they clutter the page up something awful. ———Kelisi 2005/2/7

  in view of the tenor of the quoted text, I think you have quoted it misleadingly.    
 :No, you have. For example saying the book says of vitalism that  when it in fact says """"just when its significance was being rehabilitated, it lost its value as a coherent notion"""". This source is more than ample to justify the restored PS category staying put.  ||

12343f07a1f8f703,"""== """"Everything's Magic"""" on the Charts == 

 Since there have been several back-and-forth edits regarding this section in the past month, I want to clarify why the Hot 100 chart position of """"Everything's Magic"""" should read """"111"""", and not """"11"""". As the Wiki entry for Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles states: 

  
 [The Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart] comprises 25 positions that represent songs that are close to charting on the main singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100, acting as an extension to Hot 100. Many times, singles halt their progress at this chart, and never debut on the Hot 100. For example, Kelly Clarkson's """"The Trouble with Love Is"""" stayed at #101 and never went any higher. Also, more noticeable examples are Pet Shop Boys's """"Can You Forgive Her?"""", """"Go West"""", """"Before"""", """"Somewhere"""" and George Clinton's """"Atomic Dog"""", which halted their progress in #101, #106, #107, #125 and #109 respectively, never to appear again in the chart. 

  
 On the 09/22/07 Billboard chart, """"Everything's Magic"""" occupied the 11th position on the Bubbling Under chart. That means the song's peak to-date is #111 overall, not #11. I hope this clears up any confusion.

کنکور رو اين واقعيات تو ذهنم ترسيم ميشد نوعي دوگانگي در من ايجاد شد که کدوم رو باور کنم کدوم دارن حقيقت رو ميگن اگه فرض بگيريم تمام حرفاي رسانه هاي درست باشه پس آنچه که من ديدم با چشم خودم چي يعني چشماي من داره به من دروغ ميگه تا يه مدت از اين حقيقت بيني خودم فاصله گرفتم و اصلا تحويلش نمي گرفتم ميديدم اما خودم رو ميزدم به کوري خاله ام از مشکلات مملکت ميگفت و من مدام مدافعيت ميکردم و انکار

 The section on resistance really needs a re-write. It lists Hoepner as one of the officers who """"opposed the atrocities of the Hitler regime""""(!). This is really wrong. Hoepner was one of the German generals who worked most assiduously in applying the Commissar Order and in working with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Jews in the Baltic in 1941. Hoepner most certainly did not oppose atrocities, and instead was intimately involved in the murder of defenceless Jewish men, women and children.

 Following the nationalist Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and the executions of fifteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist Sinn Féin party won a majority of seats in Ireland and set up the First Dáil (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. 

 The link from Sinn Féin, however, takes the reader to the article about the current party known by that name. I changed the link to the article about the historical party, but this was reverted.

 == Ron Paul status in this article == 

 An editor marked Ron Paul as """"out"""" at some point, and the article was left this way for several days. However, an astute editor noticed that technically Ron Paul never stepped down or out during the primaries, and continued his race all the way to the Republican National Convention. Several contests were decided *at* the convention itself, and unless someone has a reliable secondary source showing where Ron Paul actually declared himself 'out', I don't see how we can declare it here. The primaries are over, the RNC is over, Ron Paul is not the nominee, but that doesn't change the fact that he never went 'out' during the """"2012 Republican Party presidential primaries"""", which is the focus of *this* article. 

 Back up the change with reliable secondary sources or leave the article be. This is a silly thing to be edit warring over, and the fact that Ron Paul's delegates were still being contested during the RNC speaks very clearly to the idea of whether he was out.    """,0

 ==Your contributed article, Centroblasts== 
  Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Centroblasts. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Follicular lymphoma. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Follicular lymphoma - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page.  

 If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.    

 ==Your recently created articles== 
 Please be sure that you don't create articles on topics that have already been covered. Wikipedia articles are generally named in singular and e.g. specific themes like biology and medicine have already been covered extensively. So you might want to search the database for different names before you write an article that may be speedily deleted because the subject has already been covered. Regards,   """,0

 It's true that there are scholars outside the mainstream and that within mainstream scholarship there's a split about whether Jesus' eschatology was apocalyptic, but there's more agreement than this sentence suggests. The reader deserves a clear statement of the mainstream view, something like: """"Most contemporary scholars of the historical Jesus consider him to have been an autonomous, charismatic founder of a Jewish restoration movement, anticipating an imminent apocalypse."""" This view squares with Vermes, Sanders, and Theissen. We should expand on the divergent views in the body, and for the lede we could add something like: """"Other prominent scholars, however, contend that Jesus' """"Kingdom of God"""" meant radical personal and social transformation instead of a future apocalypse."""" Crossan is the most important representative of this view.

 :When weighting the importance of a given donation, there are more things to consider than the raw size of a donation. Another thing to consider is how significant a given donation is to a particular recipient. In other words, it's not just the size of the donation as a percentage of the donor's total donations, it's also the size of the donation as a percentage of the recipient's total donation receipts. Obviously, the latter more complicated to evaluate, since it requires knowing both the size of the donation and the recipient's total donation receipts.

 The whole section on sexism on men should be deleted.  Men, yes can be stereotyped but there is no sexism against men.  Men cannot experience sexism because sexism is systematic and men have not been systematically oppressed.  While women have experienced systematic sexism from being denied the right to vote, receiving less pay then men for the same job and being controlled by the dominate gender which is men, to name a few.  Their oppression has been engraved into the system to make them viewed as less than men, while that has never happened to men.  Hopefully this can be worked out some way with """"Sexism against men"""" being turned into a new page entitled """"Male stereotyping"""" or added to that page if it already exists.

c934af2d2f9bc79c,""":I'm fine with """"Celtic"""" culture not being monolithic, but if the roundhouse culture was across Britain, all of it should be included or none. To me it make more sense to think of the Celts as being loosely linked with distinctive local variations. The areas left white later became Norse territory, but up to the time of the Picts the archaeology indicates a shared culture with more southerly areas. Similarly, the Pictish language is unknown, but their territory included much more of Scotland, down near to the Forth and Clyde. Many scholars seem to think they had a Brythonic Celtic language, perhaps differing from the Brythonic spoken in Scotland south of the Pictish territory...it's an interestingly untidy period...  

 This is anything but scientific... but common French imagery about Gaul has their house round rather than rectangular. We associate the rectangular shape more commonly with the Germanic or Norse style of building. (then again, Celts ang Vikings may have had more in common than many usually guess)  

 == Pronunciation again == 

 I removed this sentence: 

 :Becuase it is not an Enlish invented word, a pronunciation with /s/ should not be accepted. 

 Aside from its spelling errors, this sentence is prescriptivist. Wikipedia doesn't tell people what to do. Furthermore, the conclusion does not follow the premise. We use words and names all the time that are from foreign languages but are pronounced like English words. For example, we pronounce """"wiener"""" as """"weener"""", not """"veener"""". We say """"Seezer"""" instead of """"Kay-sahr"""" for Caesar. In fact, very few words are """"English-invented"""", and a great many words we used are neither spelled nor pronounced the way they originally were. What makes """"Celt"""" so different? Personally, I think both pronunciations are valid. It's a POV issue, so Wikipedia has no business stating one way or the other. -    

 :: From a language point of view, both pronunciations *are* valid... in English. c as an initial consonant with /s/ sound has precedent in the English language. The /k/ sound at the beginning of 'Celt' comes from the original Greek, and this pronunciation was notably revived along with the romantic revival of 'Celticity' beginning in the 18th century in western Europe, then continuing on to the present.  

 :: So, the Boston folk are saying it correctly, but in a particular context. The descriptivist way of looking at this problem is that both are valid, but the two pronunciations are begining to be 'appropriate' according to context: /k/ when referring to 'Celtic' peoples/languages/nations, /s/ when referring to the sports teams on both sides of the Atlantic, and so on. Being on the side of the prescriptivists myself, this makes my teeth grind a bit, but such is life. )   

  
 ::: I too am a prescriptivist, and support the soft C sound, again because of _our_ origin of the word.  The ultimate origin notwithstanding, we got our word from the French language.  Historically, the /k/ pronunciation was only countenanced when actually spelling the word with a /k/.   

 ::: I understand that language evolves over time, but the short time this has been common does not lend sufficient weight to it as a 'proper' pronunciation.  I'm considering mentally modifying it to a permanent /k/ spelling so I can stop people from 'correcting' me in day to day speech.  (See: The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations, Charles Herrington Elster).

 ==Find a source== 
 Could someone give me a source to a study showing that women who have only ever had one partner don't even think about penis size? I think its the fault of us men that women think about it. We encourage them to have multiple partners, not valuing their virginity, and then complain that our girlfriends and wives are comparing us to previous partners. Fact is, most women have their first orgasm at some point from a penis, """"large"""" or """"small"""", and are happy about it, and with the exceptio of micropenis, I'm sure any woman who can come can come with a below average-sized penis, and she can enjoy it her entire life, and not want anything else. Or, one of us men with a different penis can come along and try to do better, resulting in the whole issue of comparing penis sizes.  

 ==Comments== 
 23/4/5: I've added the witty riposte to the question 'how long is your cock?' published a few years ago. It belongs in Wikipedia somewhere, I think, but I'm not sure where. There's probably a better place ... 

 :Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense -   

  

 My edit was that the size of their partners, rather than theirs, might be of concern. I think that is fair, but may have been ambiguously worded.   

 According to a class I'm taking in the Psychology department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the issue of penis size is mostly relevant to the Western world. Editing the article accordingly; if you disagree, please cite research stating the contrary before doing so. (The text book we use is Our sexuality by Robert Crooks and Karla Baur.)   

 :I just checked the text book, and I can't find the text I was thinking of, it must have been mentioned in class. As I can't find a proper reference, I'll just refrain from editing the article. If anyone _does_ have a reference, please edit the article.   

 == 2 or 2.5 Standard deviations? == 

 The micropenis article says a micropenis is 2.5 SD's or more less than average is known as a micropenis, whereas this node gives 2 SD's. Could someone with medical reference material or the appropriate know-how please make these articles consistent, or if there is no consensus, add that these are loosely defined terms?  00:42, 2004 Jun 13 (UTC) 

 It's like """"short stature"""" for goodness' sake. I suspect 2 different people wrote the sentences in the two articles originally. Of course it's arbitrary! If you really want to know the real, actual, honest-to-God major purpose of the diagnosis """"micropenis"""" it's so your insurance company will pay for the doctor consultation if we wrote """"normal variation,"""" you'd have to pay the bill yourself. (No offense intended of course... I just finished answering your quibble at talk:micropenis). If you want to check a penis growth curve, you can find one in Jones' Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation published by Saunders. 
 

 It makes sense that it's a fuzzily defined term, I just wonder if we should be giving exact numbers (without any indications of fuzziness like 'about' or 'approximately'), and inconsistent ones at that in that case. Have you got any preference for stating 2 or 2.5? I suggest we update both articles to give the same number using the word 'approximately'.  23:26, 2004 Jun 13 (UTC)

 Okay, I accept that the stem cell article, itself, has improved recently - especially in terms of presentation, clarity and succinctness - however I can’ help but feeling that we’ve done the wrong thing by creating sub-articles and divorcing much of the content away from the main article.  
 * Firstly, I suppose you could say that I object for philosophical reasons. As things stand, with the main article focusing on “the science” and the sub-article focusing on “the ethics”,  the Wikipedia community appears to be embracing the commonly held (positivistic) assumption that ‘science’ is driven by its own internal logic and can be distinguished from other pursuits such as ethics, theology and sociology. For obvious reasons, this illusory distinction is bound to appeal to the pro-research lobby who have sought to clearly and definitely draw a line in the sand between “the authoritative word of science”, on the one hand, and “ethical”/“moralistic”/luddite concerns, on the other.    
 * Secondly, I also object to recent changes on practical grounds. Maintaining multiple articles is inevitably more difficult than maintaining a single article. If a stable version of Wikipedia is ever to be published, and I’m not sure that this will (or even should) happen, it is going to be much more difficult to merge all the existing stem cell material into a useful and coherent whole. 
 * Thirdly, readers must now trawl through several different articles in order to get ‘the big picture’. 
 So, I accept that recent changes have improved the stem cell article, itself, but this minor improvement has come at the expense the communities coverage of the topic as a whole, which is now fragmented all over the place and inconsistent between articles - not to mention largely one-sided. 17:05, 2 February",0

 :There is more than a little corporate copyright infringement in the sense that some countries make little effort to regulate and enforce laws and treaties in the area, and corporate entities, sometimes anonymous, sometimes not, produce or distribute the infringing materials.

You may find that the lines between individual infringement and """"corporate"""" infringement are non-existant, or the the division is subject to severe criticism.

 The statement says, """"I became a member of La Cosa Nostra in the late 1940s but have been associated with the organization since the late1920s. My father, Joseph Lonardo, was the former boss of the Cleveland family.""""""",0

 == A few thoughts == 

 I sort of think there needs to be some kind of resolution to the fighting over this article. This log is beyond absurd: and, more to the point, when I've seen similar protection logs the dispute(s) has/have usually ended up going to ArbCom. That's not something I imagine anyone wants. Arbitrators have limited patience too. 

 As far as further disputes go, I really can't imagine what there is left to fight over. From the point of view of someone (more or less) on the outside, who's never seen the film, and, in all honesty, doesn't give two flying fucks about it either - this article is not that bad. Ok, so not FA-standard, nor A-class, or whatever, but Wikipedia has far worse trash for you to go out there and fix. Ok, so that """"academic reception"""" stuff is, at least in my opinion, a bit too long, though the film  obviously does have some notable critics (Mr Dawkins). But, hey, it's a New Age film - when we write an encyclopaedia article on such a topic, we should probably use a slightly different language-game than we would in an article on mainstream science. And, be realistic - there is no need to explicitly keep on hammering out the fact the science in the film is tosh. Most people will click on those links to the Ramtha School and JZ Knight articles. Those who don't, you won't persuade anyway. . 

 In conclusion: this article is not a perfect model of NPOV. Big deal - not. Wikipedia has far worse articles. This one is, by and large, ok. Maybe at some future stage we can come back and trim a little bit of the criticism, which is, at least in my opinion, excessive. But the unwavering obsession some people appear to have with this article is totally unwarranted. It's reasonably fair, both to fans of the film and to those who hate it. Is there any need to keep on with the quarrels and edit-wars? I warn you - if you do keep going, and this does go to arbitration, I suspect the arbitrators' reactions will be far from pleasant, particularly since some of the names of the chaps fighting here have come up in previous cases. 

 With all respect.   """,0

 :::::I don't think that statement is correct at all, to be honest.  It's incredibly mushy and confuses a number of different ideas.  Australians get to decide who their head of state is by setting laws that say who the head of state is.  They, like most countries, have so far chosen not to do that.  That is the extent to which democratic self-determination comes into play.  Once we have established that neither the Australian people nor their elected representatives have chosen to clarify the issue, Australians' opinions on the subject of """"who is the head of state under the current constitutional framework"""" are no more valid than anybody else's.  Every individual is, of course, free to regard whomever they like as head of state without interference from other people.  Nobody can force any other person to believe anything.  But Australians don't have any particular right to decide whom Wikipedia regards as the Australian head of state.  This is a well-established feature of Wikipedia which everyone recognizes when it comes to things like ethnic disputes in Eastern Europe: people from a country don't own articles about that country.   In this particular case, the question revolves around how the term """"head of state"""" is to be defined more than anything else, and Australians have no exclusive right to define standard English terms.  The standard definition of a head of state is more or less what the dictionary.com definition says: the person who holds the highest position in a national government.  It says nothing about executive power, or diplomatic representation, or actual power, or anything.  It's just """"the highest position"""".  The idea that a country can have a """"sovereign"""" who is distinct from the """"head of state"""" is alien to the most usual meaning of """"head of state"""" in the English language.   """,0

 Hey Chiswick Chap 

 I'm sending you this because you've made quite a few edits to the template namespace in the past couple of months. If I've got this wrong, or if I haven't but you're not interested in my request, don't worry; this is the only notice I'm sending out on the subject ). 

 So, as you know (or should know - we sent out a centralnotice and several watchlist notices) we're planning to deploy the VisualEditor on Monday, 1 July, as the default editor. For those of us who prefer markup editing, fear not; we'll still be able to use the markup editor, which isn't going anywhere. 

 What's important here, though, is that the VisualEditor features an interactive template inspector; you click an icon on a template and it shows you the parameters, the contents of those fields, and human-readable parameter names, along with descriptions of what each parameter does. Personally, I find this pretty awesome, and from Monday it's going to be heavily used, since, as said, the VisualEditor will become the default. 

 The thing that generates the human-readable names and descriptions is a small JSON data structure, loaded through an extension called TemplateData. I'm reaching out to you in the hopes that you'd be willing and able to put some time into adding TemplateData to high-profile templates. It's pretty easy to understand (heck, if I can write it, anyone can) and you can find a guide here, along with a list of prominent templates, although I suspect we can all hazard a guess as to high-profile templates that would benefit from this. Hopefully you're willing to give it a try; the more TemplateData sections get added, the better the interface can be. If you run into any problems, drop a note on the Feedback page.

 An actress, Jessica Custodio, posted notes about a day of filming on her myspace blog at blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=85760344&blogID;=254780801 
 but blog.myspace.com is on the Wikimedia spam blacklist, so I can't put it in External links.  
 The producer, Angela Lee, sent me a lot of information in an email, 
 but, well, that's not strictly Wikipedia:verifiable in the sense of being posted somewhere.  
 I'll post it here on the talk page. 

 Presumably more will be written about the film as it gets closer to release. 
    

 ==From Angela Lee== 

 Since Zombie Strippers is a political satire The Writer/Director (Jay Lee who's also my brother) and I always hoped we get released in 2008 during the election year. Jay wrote, directed, shot and is editing this film and a team of visual effects artists are working on shots as soon as Jay's finished a scene in order for us to be ready by October for the big genre festivals and conventions.  

 Here's a little background on the film. Use or ignore any of it as you see fit.  

 It's based on Eugene Ionesco's classic French Existential play Rhinoceros. 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_%28play%29 

 We sold the film on the title alone. Jay's first film went to Sundance in 2002 and after that he was having trouble getting green lit on a second film because his work was considered too """"intellectual"""" so we came up with the stupidest title we could think of. Once we got the green light then Jay was faced with the challenge of writing a script that wouldn't ruin his career as a serious filmmaker. Hence the French Existential twist.  

 I've attached the treatment to the film for your information and below is a director's statement that was given to the publicist at Playboy when they asked him why he cast Jenna in the lead role. 

 Feel free to contact me with any more questions.  

 As for the picture, I took it with a camera that belonged to Penny Drake, the actress. We discussed it and would both prefer to release it with """"no rights reserved"""" since we're much more interested in the publicity it could garner than photo credit. There are more behind the scenes pictures on her site at http://pennydrake.com/ under reel footage. There's a link to view the whole album on the left underneath the picture of her as a zombie. She said any of the pictures in her album can be used. If you'd like a picture of Robert Englund without Penny in it I can get one from one of the other cast or crew members. He was really really nice and easy going and posed for pictures all day long. 

 ===Director's statement about Jenna Jameson=== 

 We live in a time of blatant, brutal and deadly hypocrisy.  Sex scandals run rampant in the conservative political and religious leadership.  Wars are raged, nations bombed, bibles are thumped with roaring hatred and intolerance and yet accusatory fingers are aimed at music and movies.  Reason and fact are being ignored all in the name of a faith that looms ever so ominously over all of our lives. 

 When it comes to the sexual retrograde of this country the facts are still undeniable: since the readily availability of pornography in the home thanks to the internet, sex crimes in this country are down more than 40%.  And yet the hypocrisy of this country rages even louder, lashing out even stronger against the evils of the sex industry all in the name """"decency"""" and """"morality.""""  So what is """"morality""""?  To put millions of women at risk merely to satisfy one's own self-serving sense of decency?  Does being a good American now mean living in denial and ignorance like our current administration? 

 It is possible that this arena holds the key to turning the tides on our moral retrograde.  And it is Jenna Jameson that stands in the forefront of this debate, as crusader, scapegoat, spokesperson, hero and villain all wrapped up in one. 

 We wanted to make a film with a message disguised under the facade of a horror/comedy.  We wanted to throw the hypocrisies of our time in the face of mainstream America.  And to do that we'd need some pretty strong allies.  We'd need a strong political and social voice that was also a star, an icon that could make the film popular enough to attract an audience big enough for our message to be heard loud enough to make a difference.  It was obvious who that person was - Jenna Jameson.  And knowing of her desire to move into the world of horror movies we created a story accordingly and then attempted the impossible.

 Additionally saying """"Qasida al-Burda"""" is wrong grammatically in Arabic because it should be """"Qasidat al-Burda"""". Al-Burda is a notable enough topic that there is no need to refer to it otherwise.

dd2bbc7fe76b11c7,"""== The blue, blue sky == 

 A common complaint here from many Pascalers is that their specific version of Pascal has """"solved"""" any """"lack"""" vs. C. This creates a strong temptaton to annotate this article to """"show"""" how one particular Pascal implementation has completely closed the gap with C. 

 I added the """"Blue Sky Pascal"""" to hopefully address why I think this is better left to a specific page on a specific Pascal, rather than included wholesale here. The basic point to understand is that a combination of Pascal and C is no longer Pascal nor C. Pascal loses its type safety, and C loses its simplicity. While such combinations might be interesting elsewhere, the comparision of Pascal and C as distinct languages would lose its flavor just as much as a comparision of steak and Spam if the two were mixed together in a blender. 

 Pascal has values that are distinct from C. The fact that the common memory has forgotten this is not germane to the facts of the matter. Java and C# may be heralded as a """"revolution"""" in type safety, but that does not erase the fact that Pascal had such concepts some 30 years before.

 == Meaning of North America, sources, questions == 

 I changed the claim of Cabot being """"commonly credited as the first European to discover North America"""" to """"commonly credited as the first European to discover the mainland of North America"""", as that is how the Catholic Encyclopedia puts it. Note the (fairly) common meaning of North America includes Central America and the Caribbean where Columbus made his discoveries in 1492. The North America pages makes this clear, while noting alternate meanings. Of course even this claim is troublesome if Cabot landed on Newfoundland, since that it not the mainland. Still, the mainland statement is sourced, so. Actually the Catholic Encyclopedia takes it further, saying Cabot was """"discoverer of the American mainland""""not just North America. But as the page Americas (terminology) points out, the term """"American"""" is rather vague and problematic. So I left it as North America. Also, there is a paragraph, entirely within parentheses, which I added a """"citation needed"""" tag too: 

 *(Like his contemporary, King Francis I of France, who would send Giovanni da Verrazzano to reconnoiter even more of the Atlantic coastline, Henry VIII was in part motivated by the perceived insolence of the division of the world into two halves by Pope Alexander VI in the Bull Inter Caetera following the success of Columbus's first voyage. One half of the globe was for Portugal and the other half for Spain.) 

 I don't doubt the Inter Caetera, but am skeptical that King Francis I of France and King Henry VIII of England were """"in part motivated by the perceived insolence"""" of this papal bull. My understanding is that the Inter Caetera was never intended to be anything other than an arrangement between Spain and Portugal """"brokered"""" by the Papacy. It applied only to Spain and Portugal. France, England, and all other nations were not bound by italthough Spain tried (and rapidly failed) to persuade other nations to recognize Spanish rights to the New World based on the Inter Caetera. I am skeptical that Francis I or Henry VIII found the papal bull insolent. They might have, and if so it might have played a part in Henry's support of Cabot. But, well, I checked the references listed here and found no such information. Thus """"citation needed"""".   """,0

e12f86e1f4f60984,""" Cosby Show was that unlike most sitcoms about blacks, they never, ever mentioned the fact that they were black. Compare this to Whoopi Goldberg's unlamented sitcom, or the Jeffersons, where they could not go more than a sentence or two without bringing up race. What the Cosby Show DID do was spotlight music by black artists, or inobtrusively hang a painting by Jacob Lawrence on the wall, or have the grandparents talk about participating in civil rights marches in the 1960's. Great stuff!   

 ==Military Brat (Navy Brat)== 

 On the """"Military Brats"""" Wikipedia page, Cosby is listed as a famous 'military brat' (child of a military family, which is not considered a derogatory term by most who grew up in military families) and more specifically, he is listed as a Navy brat. A military childhood has many significant challenges and strengths associated with it, and the military aspect of Cosby's own childhood should be included here in the """"Early Life"""" section.  

 

 Also, Cosby's parents are not mentioned in the article. That is customary for wiki and also would allow us to research and document the history of military service in his family. 

 

 == Background == 

 Can we get a link to the text of his speech to support """"In the same speech he had scathing remarks for Christians and the police, as well as praise for the efforts of the Black Muslim organization and it's effectiveness, however, these statements were not reported in the articles in the mainstream media."""" 

 :The Gettosburg Address's full text is the link that needs to be moved to WikiSource has the full text for review (those statements appear at the middle and end of the speech). I'm not sure how to have that done so I would appreciate anyone who does that &/r explains how to do it.   (p.s. plz sign your comments) 

 """"There wasn't any proof that these last two alleged allegations took place and Cosby was acquitted."""" This is very poor.  No details are offored of any trials, just that allegations were made. Can we have at least a mention of whether a trial took place, adn poreerably whoch court, links to transcripts if anyone can find them.    

 ::::The background section needs MAJOR work. It is completely unsourced and frequently POV. With the intense scrutiny Wikipedia receives regarding entries on real people, a section such as this would seem to fail to meet the necessary standards of Wiki for biographical entries. But for the loss of a great deal of information, I would be inclined to delete the entire section. Hopefully someone can find the time for the badly-needed rewrite.   

 == Opinion/Vandalism in Personal Life == 

 The wikipedia entry should include that Autumn Jackson was eventually acknowledged as Bill Cosby's biological daughter. A fact he knew(but denied publically for years) since she was a child and would visit her and her mother, and would have them visit his tv 'set'.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 Can you provide a source for claim that he has acknowledged her as his daughter?  All I see are articles from late 90s saying Jackson declined to take a DNA test. 

 I'm not sure it is academically profitable for an article to indicate that Cosby had an """"ugly"""" wife, nor to comment on her academic standing unless the author would like to cite a credible source for the proposition.  Second,  I don't think it is necessary to repeat the stories of his possible indiscretions, once in the article is likely enough to bring it to the reader's attention. 

  

 I'm going to revert this. If I'm wrong, sorry.

 == Yoga Edit == 

 Hi guys! This yoga section is amazing. Here are just some main points to possibly improve it a bit: 

 * I feel like the first sentence is a little redundant as """"popular"""" and """"commonplace"""" imply similar things. You could probably make this sentence more concise.  
 * You get back in forth between saying """"yoga"""" or """"Yoga"""" with a capital Y. I don't know if there is a reason for this but if not then I feel you should keep it consistent throughout the whole text. 
 * You start one sentence with """"In the West"""" and then the next sentence with """"Within the West"""" - this repetition messes with the flow of the piece  
 * You reference """"Ashram"""" residence but you should define what this is for people who don't know - or maybe even link to the Ashram wikipedia page? 

 == Meditation Edit == 

 Ahhhh this one was so interesting as well! Here's a couple points on it: 

 * You do the same thing as in yoga with switching between a capital """"M"""" and lowercase in meditation. It would be better to stick with just one. 
 * I also feel like """"a Buddhist way of being religious"""" could be worded better. Maybe """"a religious competent in Buddhism"""" or something along those lines.  
 * I can't believe there's a whole wikipedia page for Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction - Ha I love it!! 
 * """"lessening illness"""" sounds awkward - maybe use """"preventing illnesses""""? 
 * For """"secular pieces of Western society, such as hospitals and schools"""" maybe say """"secular institutions of Western society, such as hospitals and schools"""" instead? 

 Overall this sounds amazing!!! Feel free to don't listen to my edits if you don't agree with them - obviously you know the topic better than I do. But I love it!!!!""",0

 picture than your appeal or any encouragement to participate in this 
 brilliant venture called 'Wikipedia'. 

 I am reminded of a Linus Torvalds quote. 

 What Linux myths or misconceptions do you find particularly galling?. 
 Torvalds responds. 

 I don’t get upset that easily, so I can’t say that there is any in 
 particular that I find galling. One myth that I find interesting, but 
 which has nothing to do with Linux or even the IT sector in 
 particular, is the myth of how a single person or even a single 
 company makes a huge difference in the market. It’s the belief that 
 things happen because somebody was visionary and “planned” it that 
 way. Sometimes the people themselves seem to believe it, and then the 
 myth becomes hubris. 

 I have to continually try to explain to people that no, I don’t 
 “control” what happens in Linux. It’s about having an environment that 
 is conducive to development, not so much about any particular leader. 
 And I think that is true in most cases, be it the “great sport coach” 
 or the “great spiritual leader.”",0

 This is the first time I've really read the article (the one edit I made was pretty easy based on the diffs) and holy crap it needs help.  I've only been through a few of the references but so far it doesn't look good for the article.  That said, he doesn't appear to be entirely non-notable.  I don't know what to say, it will take several hours to go through and excise everything that's OR or is """"supported"""" by bogus references and see what's left (if anything).  So here are some ideas as to how to proceed.  First (you should create a subpage here for this), let's go through all the references one by one, noting the text in the article, where the reference goes, if the reference says what it's supposed to, and if it's a good reference (i.e., not a blog, forum post, or non-notable site).  Once that list is in place post it on the Talk page for the article and let's see if we can build a consensus that A) there is a problem and B) you've outlined the major problems that need fixing.  Actually we should just do that and then see where it might lead.  Maybe there will be enough left to make a legitimate article or maybe we'll need to go to WP:PROD.  In any case, the process needs to be transparent, inclusive, and always assuming good faith on the part of the other editors involved.  If things get contentious and outside help is needed (like say WP:ANI) then if you've followed good form it'll be a whole lot easier to make your point.  I'll help where I can.

Davies concludes that if the the Second World War would not had happened, and the policies were kept in place, Kresy might have been a scene of a civil war. Ukrainians were already throwing bombs and assasinating Polish politicians, and it was all 'going to hell in a handbasket'.

 == Post-mortem == 

 Actually, I don't have too much to say. Student reaction was mixed-to-positive this semester, and it seems clear that all the structure-providing strategies worked pretty well. Students most often felt, however, that they received little feedback and had little contact with the Wikipedia world. Some claim they will continue editing; many claim that they will go to Wikipedia for information in future (about which I feel a bit ambivalent, giving their disdain of libraries...). In any event, I will not be returning to the job in the fall, and I don't see at present any likelihood of the project being carried on by others. But it was an interesting experiment, and students who put their back into it had positive learning outcomes... 
    
 :which sounds unnecessarily ambivalent! Many thanks for all your selfless assistance! 
    

 ::That sounds pretty good. Perhaps we were a bit overly absent this time, but the outcome was good. Anyway, we all saw the chaos from too much presence. 

 ::Disdain for libraries is natural. This is 2012. Wikipedia, baby! ) 

 ::I wouldn't call my assistance selfless. I'm part of the BORG, and we're selfishly greedy for product, which is what we got. Cost-benefit wise, it was a good deal, I think. I hope on your end it was worth it. And I hope for the students it was valuable. I hope they continue to edit. Who knows, Wikipedia is pretty addictive. Trouble is, it's not, for some reason, contagious. Odd. Now, if we can just nuke that darn Baidu Baike, all will be well. That whole operation is competition, unsourced 狗屁听说, and pure copyvio. When the world's commerce or government is all under one name, that's very bad. But when all information is linked, that's good, I think. I wish Wikipedia would catch on more in China.

 :: To answer your question, it's considered vandalism because   
 There is a set format for Wikipedia articles - have a look at Wikipedia:Manual of style for an example of the types of guidelines we follow.  All articles are different, but for the total Wikipedia package to work, there needs to be some conventions followed about how articles are set out.  All articles need to have a similar look and feel, and need to convey the impression that they are part of a larger """"set"""" of articles.  The Blondie article you keep contributing is jarring both visually and in terms of its style.  Doesn't mean it's inaccurate, just inappropriate.   This format was set up before you got here, and before I got here, and it's still evolving.   

 The articles grow and are edited by consensus.  This means you have equal right to contribute but it does not mean you have more right.   If you are overruled by several people on something that you want to put in an article, you have to be gracious about it, and just accept that you don't win them all.   When several people change your edits, and you arrogantly change them back without considering that your opinion is just one of many, you are basically saying that your opinion is worth more than everyone else's.   When you then stubbornly revert back to something that has already been explained to you as inappropriate, that's vandalism.  It's not part of working in a community, where you would be very welcome if you took the time to try to understand how things work.  

 Several times you have made numerous words bold in the Blondie article.  Find me one other article here, where every noun, or person's name, or album name etc are bold, and where it has remained that way after consensus from other contributors, and I'll stop protesting.  You won't find such an article though.  Also you persistently add the """"Blondie is this, Blondie is that etc. Blondie is something else"""" statement. It looks like an advertising slogan.  It belongs on a fan page because it's strong and it's effective.  It's not encyclopedic though, and that's why it doesn't belong here.  It's a point of view, and whether the point of view is right or wrong is not the point, the tone of these articles should be neutral.   

 You obviously have a lot to contribute, but you seem to be not interested in learning how this system works.  You could actually improve these Blondie articles, because they have always been severely lacking.  I think it's a shame because you're obviously passionate and knowledgeable about this subject.

 The Article said that Dancing Queen was a No.2 Hit in Canada. It was - in one of the lesser Charts. 
 In the main Canadian Singles Chart - RPM - it was a No.1 Hit. I also see that the Article carries 
 on the fallacy that it sold 'over 3 million' copies. It had sold that by the end of 1976. It was  
 still in many Top 10's at that time - into 1977. It sold a USA Million in 1977. It was a Canadian 
 No.1 in 1977. By the end of the 1970's it had sold 6 Million. So your Article gives it just 50% 
 of its 1970's Sales. Since the 1970's it has gone on to sell about 300,000 as a 1992 reissue, & 
 in; the past Decade it has sold at least 1 Million in Downloads. With over 100,000 in the UK, & 
 over; 600,000 in the USA. It is ABBA's best selling Single. And Wikipedia says around 3 Million 
 copies sold, just because a 1980's Book said so, & a later Book copied off that big mistake.

 ::::Your first quotation does not support either of the two disptuted statements (""""Canada has been a monarchy since 1534"""" and """"there have been 33 sovereigns of Canada""""). While I might dispute that the office of the monarch is the oldest continuous and unbroken institution in Canada—could not it be the Catholic Church?—the second quotation says nothing about 1534 or 33 sovereigns. All it says is that the Crownas an institution has existed in Canada since before 1867, a point not in dispute. Third quotation is not from a reliable source, which is a good thing, since it's baloney. The Canadian Crown has nothing in it of the old French crown and the claims made by the French which were transferred to the English in 1763 could just as well have been made and transferred by a republic as by the French monarchy. The 1583 date seems to contradict our assertion that 1497 is the important one. 
 ::::The statement that """"32 French and British kings and queens have reigned over Canada"""" is not the same as """"there have been 33 sovereigns of Canada"""". The term """"sovereign of"""" has different implications from """"reigned over"""". The Canadian Encyclopedia's statement is not objectionable. I don't think royal.gov.uk is a reliable source for reasons already stated, but its statement seems to trade on ambiguity—not to mention that it is in conflict with the dates of 1497 and 1583 for the start of British monarchical rule. The ambiguity is in the word """"monarchy"""", which could mean a type or system of government, or could mean a country with a monarch as its head of state. Canada (as this article understands it) was not such a country prior to 1867, but the French and British colonies (there were several) were always under a monarchical form of government (with the exception of Cromwell's time). 
 ::::""""There may have been two lines before 1763, but its evident neither of those two is considered apart from the present one."""" You can't consider them apart, because what is Canada now (and what was Canada in 1867) was divided between them in the 16th–18th centuries.

 ==Accents== 
 These need to go, the actors basing their voice on someone from a particular region does not make it the accent of that region. It's entirely subjective. I don't know about the American accents but Stewie is reported to have an 'English' accent. Accents vary hugely in England (as I'm sure they do in the US) It's not uncommon for someone to not be able to understand a word another person that lives 300 miles away says due to accent. Accents can't be proven so they either go or it's changed to say that the voice is based on someone from (insert region here).    

 This info is quite valid, and i have replaced it. Accents are well documented, recognised, quoted, and parodied. 
 The fact that accents vary within a country is irrelevant.  
 Stewie is said to """"have what some consider an upper-class affected English accent and stereotypical archvillain phrases"""", It does not say he has just an English accent.   

 Accents cannot be proven, they are entirely subjective. """"an upper-class affected English accent"""" - is that a Mancunian, Liverpudlian or Somerset accent? There are upper-class people in all these areas. If you want to include this information state what the accents are intended to be, not what they 'are'.

Some notable states with large territorial disputes that do not have maps that follow this convention are as Knowledgekid pointed out Somalia, Azerbajian, Venezuela, Suriname, Estonia, and Syria. Of these the maps are mixed in what they depict. Some maps like that of Azerbajian and Syria depict what is claimed, others like Venezuela and Suriname depict what is controlled. In most other states that have disputes but their map not depicting them, the area disputed is much to small to be shown on the map (as in the United States for instance). My view is that the policy on these maps needs to be brought to a single standard and that the light green shading for areas claimed but not in control of the central state is a good one that is already mostly in place and should be put in place here on the malian page as well.

82ed03dde832b430,"::Before we transfer this discussion to the article's talk page, I want to say that I'm entirely ok about omitting the orgasm part because I don't have sources for that (only the knowledge that the connection with genitals is present in males too, and some anecdotal evidence - that doesn't count here, I know - that it is possible for a male to orgasm through it, and not at all rare to orgasm through strong mixed stimulation of nipples and anus), but I still find the section on their, uh, sexiness, a bit of a double standard. The design of the male chests around the nipple area can be aesthetically pleasing and a fetish too, some males of a mostly queer* audience are interested in heightening these aspects, and not only males appreciate women's breasts. Combined with this and the impression that only nipples were erogenous, the impression that section gave me was that there was an unawareness of the fact that male bodies can be appreciated in an about equal manner and of the existence of homosexuality. If we can get sources for that (and I'm pretty sure it is nowhere near hard, no pun intended), I don't see many reasons to comment over it.",0
e34b3cf192c9edb5,""":It's not the tech blokes who mess up the entire thing, it's the politicians, as usual. Technically, a contact-only card would serve the exact same purpose, for example, and do away with half the problems. Likewise, technically, all the mechanisms that actually could hope to make this thing halfway """"secure"""" are optional... surely not by wish of the tech guys. All in all: your (and my) government doesn't give a damn about your well-being and those rights they did not (yet) take away from you, and solely cares about how to better keep tabs on you. Telling you things would enable you to keep checks on their actions, and they don't avoid that like the plague for no reason. By their own mantra """"who has nothing to hide has nothing to fear (from having no privacy)"""", governments prove through their very own paranoid fear of being checked, that they do have something to hide.
